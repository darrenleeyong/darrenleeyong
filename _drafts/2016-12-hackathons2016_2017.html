        This hackathon was on a larger scale and had more focus on technicalities of the hack.
        Our product was 'Percusso' - an analytic tool for music makers where users will critique and comment on different parts of the song. 
        Invited to Bandlab's (sponsor) office for further discussions.

      <h2> NewAge Hackathon 2.0 (2016). </h2>
      <p> 
        First ever hackathon.  
        <a href="https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/newage-hackathon-20-tickets-24949401331#" target="_blank" > NewAge Hackathon 2.0</a> 
        was a good and beginner-friendly hackathon with a core focus on social themes such as depression and loneliness for the elderly or youth. 
        I teamed up with Gao Fei, our pitch guy, and Sathish, junior Android Dev, for this hackathon and thought of an idea inspired by Pokemon Go (which just came out very recently).
        The idea was targeted at the elderly to go to checkpoints in Singapore and do actvities, collecting points which can be redeemed for discount vouchers or the such.
        We got an honorary mention by the chairman of SG100, 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kokchintay?ppe=1" target="_blank" >Kok Chin Tay,</a>
        to work on the idea.

      <h2> Hackathons are fun and great for learning. </h2>
      <p>
        Despite the 
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5302940" target="_blank" > controversy of hackathons,</a>
        I still think that hackathons are a great avenue to think out of the box, apply creativity in problem solving and a test of your limits. 
        If you want to learn more about group dynamics, get ideas and inspiritation, and know your skill level, hackathons are just the place to be at.
