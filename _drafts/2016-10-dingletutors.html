      <h2> Logo Design and Name Card Design. </h2>
      <p> 
        Creating a logo for  
        <a href="https://dingletutors.com/" target="_blank" > Dingle Tutors.</a> 
        Made use of typography techniques, graphics, and color schemes to best represent the theme of education, lightbulb and quality.
        Name cards are an important networking tool. A good name card leaves a big impression that could help you close your next deal.
        Incorporating the same elements from the logo design, I composed the colors, the text and geometry to make a harmonious, easy-on-the-eye design.

      <h2> Logo design is not easy. </h2>
      <p>
        Logo is not easy and I can understand why designers are charging a high price for their services. 
        The logo not only represents the entire company but also the values and personality it wants to communicate to their audiences.
        It has to be unique and able to stand out from the rest of the competition.
        This project was done free but it was a great chance to exercise my knowledge on logo and to practice Adobe Illustrator.
        There are many great resources out there to learn about
