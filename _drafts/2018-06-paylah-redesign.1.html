      <h3 class="section" id="section0"> Project Summary </h3>

      <p align="center">Originally featured on <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/my-country-wants-to-go-cashless-so-i-redesigned-a-digital-wallet-dbs-paylah-140fed1a81cb" target="_blank">Medium.</a></p>

      <p>
        A personal project inspired by personal frustration with the PayLah! app experience - too many steps in completing payments and many unused features on the home screen. I conducted guerrilla user research, redesigned the app interactive prototype, and shared my findings via a case study on Medium. The project reached <b>6,000 views within a week</b>, got me invited to Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) to talk about the project, and received praise from <b>Senior Managers of banks such as UOB, OCBC, DBS, and Designers from companies like IBM, PayPal, and Pivotal.</b>

       <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-day-rally-singapore-to-go-bigger-on-e-payments-with-9140068" target="_blank">With Singapore’s recent push towards adopting cashless payments</a>, 
       the development of new technology and adoption of digital payment methods became rampant. Paylah! is a <b>mobile payment solution </b> by Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) where transfers are done through a registered mobile number/QR codes. 
       <br><br>
       
       The app was first introduced as an alternative to internet banking for <b>peer-to-peer transactions</b>. In recent years, payment at brick-and-mortar stores was made possible.

      <h3 class="section" id="section2"> Problem  </h3>
      <p>

        <!--<a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/paylah.jpeg" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/paylah.jpeg" alt="image-1" /></a>
        <br><br>-->

        Despite the new look on the app from an update this year, the peer-to-peer transfer process still <b>felt sluggish and the app is cluttered with a surplus of underutilized features</b> that potentially impedes frequent use. I felt that the user experience had  <i>much room for improvement</i>.
        <br><br>

        To develop a better understanding, I <b>recreated the existing PayLah! experience</b> for non-users and international friends:
        <br><br>

        <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/4bae673?emb=1&iosapp=false&frameless=false" width="453" height="884" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <br><br>

        The home screen is <b>littered with tons of features</b> and the <b>payment process has redundant steps</b> like repeated confirmations. PayLah! has great potential to encourage the move towards cashless as the bank has a relatively large
        <a href="https://www.dbs.com/annualreports/2017/deeper.html" target="_blank">user base of 785,000</a>. 
        However, the service only has 15,000 daily transactions, translating to <b>just about 1.9%</b> of total number of accounts (not even accounting for multiple transactions per account). 
        
        <!--
          Improving the experience has an impact on adoption and 'stickiness' - <a 
        href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/03/23/the-bottom-line-why-good-ux-design-means-better-business/#347d03612396" target="_blank">when user experience is great, people are more likely to return for regular usage or day-to-day transactions.</a> -->

        <br><br>
        Thus, this case study/redesign was inspired to encourage usage and adoption through a better user experience - for users, by a user. My process is guided by qualitative user research, identifying and solving user needs, and utilizing Google's Material Design guidelines.

      <h3 class="section" id="section3">Research: a closer look at the app</h3>

            <h4>User Research/Problem Validation</h4>
          <p>
            I conducted a <b>guerrilla user research</b> in 2 weeks and interviewed 30+ participants of different demographics including working adults and a <b>former employee of DBS</b>, but majority were millennials in their 20's, and some had experience with payment apps in the US and China. Some were not PayLah! users but I still gathered insights of why they are not using the app.

            <br><br>
            Here are my findings:
            <ul>
              <li> <b>100%</b> don't use/didn't noticed the everyday payments section on front page </li>
              <li> <b>91%</b> don't see/didn't notice the deals on the front page </li>
              <li> <b>'Pay' and 'Scan QR' are the most-used functions</b> in the app (No one interviewed used 'Request' or 'My QR code'.)</li>
              <!--<li> Most who use 'Scan QR' function started using it only during a campaign that gave a $0.50 discount (economic benefit) in select locations</li>-->
              <li> <b>Most don't know about the availability of PayNow function (a method to transfer inter-bank)</b> inside PayLah! Few who knows about it said that it is not obvious </li>
              <li> Non-users are not using PayLah! due to various reasons like confusion (e.g. PayNow versus PayLah!), difficulty in tracking expenses, security concerns, and the idea of handling yet another 'separate' account </li>
            </ul> 
          </p>


          <p>
            <!--Some other noticeable quotes:-->
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes"> "I scared 'malu' (embarassed) for holding the line if I take too long to pay with PayLah!. I'm not used to it but I know it's just a matter of getting used to." - Manager, Female, 50's</i>
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes"> "Personally, its a bit messy. PayLah! has so many 'squares'. You wouldn't want to go and explore. It's not straightforward. It was first introduced as a concept and notion of fund transfer. So I didn't bother to go explore because of that first impression." - Recent Graduate, Male, Mid-20's</i>
            <br><br>
            <!--<i class="quotes"> "I only have PayNow. PayLah quite troublesome actually. It's like holding another account. Need transfer money to there." - Marketer, Female, 30's</i>-->
            <br><br>
            An interesting finding from an ex-DBS employee was that banks like DBS are very aggressive in pushing for cashless to <b>reduce ATM transactions</b>. The cost of maintaining ATMs is very high due to the need to purchase security, transportation, and insurance for the machines implemented islandwide. Therefore, going cashless is a win-win for both parties - saving costs for banks and providing convenience for users.
          </p>
          <br><br>


            <h3>Competitive Analysis of DBS PayLah!</h3>            
          <p>
            To better assess the depth of the problem, I conducted a <b>competitive analysis</b> with similar services. I had a great experience with Venmo when I was in the Bay Area in 2017 and will be using Venmo as a comparison/benchmark. 
            
            <!--No wonder it was rated 
            <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-money-transfer-app" target="_blank">No. 1 money transfer app of 2018 by TechRadar </a>
            as well as obtaining a revered status: <b>verb</b> (e.g "I just Venmoed you 5 bucks").-->
            <br><br>
          </p>


            <h4>Seamless, frictionless peer-to-peer transfers</h4>
          <p>
            Making payments to my friends has never been so simple with Venmo. Venmo has a seamless transfer process where it takes only <b>8 steps</b> (taps & events) to complete a transaction to a contact compared to DBS requiring <b>at least 13 steps.</b>
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/payments_compare.gif" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/payments_compare.gif" alt="image-1" /></a>
            <br><br>
            In Venmo, payments are <b>people-centric </b> where the form has the <b>recipient's field placed first</b>, followed by the amount, and a compulsory description of the payment. When the 'pay/request' button is pressed, a contact list immediately pops up to your top people (people whom you had often transactions with) and friends list, skipping an extra tap. The process is also hastened by considerations such as a confirmation prompt on the same button and bringing the user directly to the home page displaying their successful transaction.
            <br><br>
          </p>

            <h4>Home Page/Social Feed</h4>
          <p>
            <b>According to <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users" target="_blank">Hick's Law</a>, 
            the more choices the users are presented with, the longer it takes to make a decision.</b> The home page of PayLah! has <b>14 different buttons/choices</b>. Including the little padding and lack of distinction between each feature, the home screen looks like a deposit of icons. Everything below the pink-gradient fold with the main features is more likely to be ignored as observed in my user research. 
            <br><br>
            In comparison, the home screen on Venmo shows a social feed of transactions. There is only one button on the top right to make/request a payment. It is straightforward and the user performs their intended task: <b>monetary transfers.</b>
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/dbs_vs_venmo_homescreen.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/dbs_vs_venmo_homescreen.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes">"I use PayLah! for one purpose - to transfer to friends. Everything else, I don't really care." - Entrepreneur, Male, mid-20's</i>
            <br><br>
          </p>

            <h4>Product Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            Venmo has taken on more of a <b>social approach</b> to peer-to-peer payments with features such as a social feed, forced messages within payments, encouraged use of emojis, and a global feed. It can be integrated with your Facebook account and the ease of seeing your friends (and their friends) allows one to make payments to mutual friends or people not in your contact list easily.
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/venmoglobal.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/venmoglobal.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
            <br><br>
            The approach DBS is taking is similar to <b>WeChat Pay</b> where payments can be made for anything, ranging from utility bills to movie tickets. Similar features are accessible on the PayLah home page but two problems exist: <b>1) it feels really cluttered and 2) no one I interviewed uses these functions.</b>
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/dbs_vs_wechat_homescreen.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/dbs_vs_wechat_homescreen.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes">"I like WeChat. Feels like PayLah! is copying. Can pay for movie tickets, bills, takeout, and a lot of things. I am impressed because can perform so many functions and doesn't feel confusing. It's very straightforward. But DBS PayLah! feels very messy and a bit hard to navigate. WeChat is clean and slick." -  Graduate, Male, mid-20's</i>

      <h3 class="section" id="section4">The Redesign </h3>

          <h4>Users' Problems to Solve</h4>
          <p>
            Based on my interview findings and research, these are the objectives identified for the redesign:
            <ul>
              <li> Increase <b>visibility of PayNow</b> service within app</li>
              <li> Remove clutter in front page and <b>improve information architecture</b> within app</li>
              <li> Make <b>peer-to-peer payments fast</b>, accounting for reach accessibility of one hand (think payments at store when other hand is occupied) </li>
              <li> Make payment with <b>QR code easier to use</b> </li>
              <li> Make <b>finding unlisted people</b> easier</li>
              <li> Introduce economic benefit for increased usage</li>
              <li> Last but not least, make the entire experience <b>enjoyable</b></li>
            </ul> 
          </p>
          <br><br>

          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>
            Understanding the users' problems to be solved, I sketched out on pen and paper various versions of mock ups, with each screen aiming to solve the various problems users listed.
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/wirefames.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/wirefames.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
          </p>

          <h4> My Design Process</h4>
          <p>
            It was time to build a high-fidelity prototype. I created a style guide through inference from their latest collateral as DBS's style guide was not made readily public*. I was able to whip up a complete UI library within minutes with <b>Google's Material Theme Editor</b> based on the style guide. For unavailable components I require, I designed custom parts based on existing components in the library.
            <br><br>
            *Edit: I did not do an extensive enough search. Their style guide is available right

      <h3 class="section" id="section5"> Final Result </h3>
      <p>
        After a few sleepless nights (and jugs of coffee), I finished designing an interactive prototype of the PayLah I envision. I excitedly showed it to some friends and tweaked it a little more after a round of feedback to before getting to a final version. 
        I conducted simple usability tests with 
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/" target="_blank">  &lt; 10 participants </a>
        and checked if my proposed solution solved their pain points. Their thoughts are presented in the quotes below.
      </p>

      <h4>Rapid peer-to-peer payments</h4>
        <p>
          My priority was to make the core features of the app (peer-to-peer transactions and payments via QR code) lightning fast — <b>as little taps as possible, with the reach accessibility of one hand.</b> I followed Venmo’s method of bringing the contact list and number pad up straightaway and included a ‘Top People’ section showing people whom you frequently and recently interacted with. Additionally, I combined the 'Pay' and 'Request' pages via a tab at the top right corner so that the request function will be utilized more. 
          <br><br>
          You can see a lot of inspiration from Venmo here as I felt they perfected the UX flow for payments.
          <br><br>
          <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/PayLah-Redesign-Pay.gif" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/PayLah-Redesign-Pay.gif" alt="image-1" /></a>
          <br><br>
          I also tidied up the information architecture and hid away the underutilized payment functions in a separate tab for a cleaner home page.
          <br><br>
          <i class="quotes">"What will be awesome if you streamline everything. When you launch the app, it is it to fund transfer/payment of good. Just make it very easy, just 2 options - just transfer funds or payment at stores." - Student, Male, 20's</i>
          <br><br>
          PayLah! has a username that is only visible to the user (why?). In order to find unlisted friends besides through a phone number or QR code, one can now search for a username/phone number that is linked to an account. Scanning QR can be done via the quickly-accessible floating action button on the contact list page.
          <br><br>
          <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/contactlist.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/contactlist.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
        </p>

      <h4>Brick-and-mortar payments made convenient</h4>
        <p>
          The payment page at brick-and-mortar stores can now be accessed before reaching the counter. You won’t ever have to worry about holding up the line when using PayLah! now (you don’t even need to scan!). Photos of the storefront also help users know that they are paying to the right vendors.
          <br><br>
          <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/PayLah-Redesign-Scan-QR.gif" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/PayLah-Redesign-Scan-QR.gif" alt="image-1" /></a>
           <br><br>
          <i class="quotes">"I like it. I get to do the things I want really fast such as Pay and Scan QR. Now I also don't have to hold the line when paying with QR code. Smart!" - Entrepreneur, Male, 20's</i>
        </p>
      
      <h4>Brick-and-mortar store payments made easys</h4>
       <p> 
         When did requesting money become such a chore? According to my research, usually one requests for money when they cover a bill for their group. Introducing <b>Bill Splitter</b> - add items and its cost to each person to break down your bill including a section that for shared items. Utilizing <b>Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</b> technology, you can drag items and its cost from an attached receipt to the portion. The attached receipt to prevent alternating between your gallery and the app. If you are unable to get the breakdown from the OCR, enter a new line manually for each item on your bill and the app will split it accordingly.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          Oh and humans tend to be forgetful. So let the app remind your friends to make payment on time.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
       </p>

      <h4>Brick-and-mortar store payments made easys</h4>
       <p> 
         Payment with PayNow is more obvious with a <b>microcopy ('PAYNOW-enabled')</b> right below their wallet's balance and the contact list would show who is registered with PAYNOW.

          <i class="quotes">"I didn't know that PayNow was already inside PayLah!" - Entrepreneur, Male, 20's</i>
       </p>
       
      <h4>Engineering 'fun'</h4>
       <p> 
         I included a 'like' button as a form of <b>confirmation feedback</b> for users to acknowledge received payment. Furthermore, I tried to engineer 'fun' into the process - when a user enters an emoji (standard unicode) as the first character of a message, it replaces the default 'like' button in a transaction line, for a more personalized experience. Messages are still left optional but this encourages users to input emojis to make the experience feel a little more unique/personalized. I decided not to make the app social and instead, focus on improving the interaction only between the people involved.

         Users would want to know relevant information to be motivated to explore the app. As an e-wallet app, it made perfect sense to include promotion codes to be used at PayLah!-enabled stores. As seen from the increased usage from a discount campaign, promo codes, <b>as a form of economic benefit,</b> encourages patrons’ usage of the ‘Scan QR’ function. Allowing vendors to submit promotions attract more customers to patronize the store and deal with less physical cash.

      <h4>Red Packets … Just Because</h4>
       <p> 
         Singapore has a 
         <b><a href="https://www.indexmundi.com/singapore/demographics_profile.html" target="_blank">74.3% Chinese population</a></b>
         and Lunar New Year is a pretty big deal here - Red Packets are a must, so why not make the experience of giving digital red packets more exciting? The problem with the existing eAngBao feature on PayLah! is that it does not feel unique or any different than a standard transaction. I spiced things up in this redesign to make the red packet experience more meaningful. You can choose from several different featured designs sponsored by brands (as a form of their own marketing) or even customize your own design.

          <br><br>
          Red Packets are a symbol of good luck and prosperity and the eAngBao experience should be tad more special! You can also select gamified options such as a random amount (between a range) and a random recipient (between your group of friends) when sending an eAngbao for fun.

          Overall, I was really pleased with the reactions I got from the people I presented my prototype to. The redesign challenged my time management skills and also forced me to get out of my comfort zone to learn more about conducting user research and using Principle for motion design.

          Unfortunately, it was only upon completion that I realized some of the ideas I came up with, such as reminders and splitting the bill, already existed in WeChat (Those geniuses!!!).

          Throughout the past month, I learned a lot about my role as a UX designer to do the thinking of how one accomplishes a task - so that users (and hopefully, developers) don't have to. I also gained mad respect to product leaders out there.

          Kudos to DBS for developing such a service that improve our lives by simplifying everyday payments to our friends and stores! 👍
          and a big thanks to the users who contributed their precious time to assist me with my research. 🙏🏻
