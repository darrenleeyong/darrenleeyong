## What 'Value' can Designers Bring?

Asides from creating pretty graphics and cool-looking illustrations, being a **GREAT** designer is not all about the pixels. As designers, we craft end-to-end experiences from the first use of a product until they stop using it.
Which happens to be the worst case scenario as we do not want users to stop using a given product and come back to it again if the need arises. To understand how we can create better experiences we first have to understand the *user*.


## User Experience Design? 

User Experience (UX) Design is an emerging and in-demand field since the proliferation of modern technologies not limited to mobile phones, but also computers in everything (think Internet of Things). As such, every product, be it electronic or not, should aim to guide the user from the start to end so that they will be satisfied and businesses will be able to accelerate their growth and sales as satisfied users will only churn more growth.

Understanding the user has become increasingly essential when new products or features are to be being thought of. 
Development time and resources poured into building new products or features are costly and prior understanding of the users' needs will certainly make a bigger impact.
Without understanding our users' needs, they would choose one or the other options:

    1) attempt to adapt to the new features or 
    2) give up on learning (or the product) 

My job as a UX designer is to prevent 2) from happening and to help minimize the number of steps to adapt to new features while providing an enjoyable/satisfiable experience. 

A great UX designer usually puts on multiple hats: 

* **Researchers / Scientists** - We ask questions and conduct tests to debunk myths and hypotheses based off certain assumptions as we build our products.
* **Analysts** - We  draw insights based off the collected data and define focus and scope of the problem.
* **Behavior Psychologists** - We put ourselves in the users' shoes to design a solution — Empathize to understand thought processes, the emotions they feel when using the product, and run through many questions how they would go about using the product.
* **Communication Experts** - Efficiently get an intended message to the end user and prevent miscommunication. 
* **Critical Problem-solvers** - We have to think a few steps ahead of a use and outside the box for solutions. 
* **Product Managers** - Understand the constraints (non-technical and technical) and requirements of the project as you build your solution.
* **Creative Artists** - Having a visual flare to present your solution to others is also an important aspect of providing a satisfactory experience. 

> #### tl;dr —Great UX designers are data-driven analysts, great communicators, creative and critical thinkers, and people-oriented team players. We strengthen the bridge between the user and product.

## My Design Process

I usually start the process with preliminary research and set the **focus** of the project before working on understanding the constraints around it. 

As designers entering an age where there are many considerations to take note of, we have to keep ourselves up to date within technical constraints by understanding the technologies behind the products, within legal and government restrictions of usage, along security and privacy guidelines, on top of our user-centered processes in order to build a successful product. 

We set goals to work towards to and then start answering the important questions — **Who** are we designing for? **Why** do we want to achieve this? **What** are the current solutions? **How can I better improve it?**

Answering these questions will provide clarity and focus on the project as you will build your designs around the answers. If you don't have these questions guiding your work, you have to do more research so you will design something that **solves the problem**.
If you do have answers to these questions, **DOCUMENT IT**. Share it with the rest of your team! Get them on the same page as you. They will be able to provide higher quality feedback and when they are working on their tasks, the end goal is in mind.

Once I'm done with setting the constraints and scope around the project, (here comes the fun part) I proceed to brainstorm on ideas on how to solve the problem, to make the user experience better. I don't discount any ideas (no matter how dumb) at this stage and just pile it all up before I filter it down. 

Once I have decided on an approach to the problem, I have to make it **visual** — for the idea/concept is then stuck in your head and no one else can see it. Let it out. Put it out on pen & paper (low fidelity). Don't spend too much time on desiging this. As long as you communicate it well, a very simple sketch is able to demonstrate a grand idea.

Now you have something visual to demonstrate your idea! Go share it with your team and get *feedback, reiterate new changes, repeat*. 

I take the low fidelity sketches and then work with my design tools (Sketch, Photoshop) to design mock ups look close to the final product / solution. If it interactive, link it up and make it as close as possible to the expeirence you have imagined from the beginning. I use [InVision](https://http://invisionapp.com/) to link up screens in my mock ups to transform it into a fully functional prototype. 

Share that prototype and go back into that feedback loop again — gather, reiterate, repeat. 

Once it has been declared as a viable product to be released, depending on the nature of the project, you could hand it off to the development team to work on your designs or export it to a final version. 

As a [Full Stack Designer](https://medium.muz.li/what-is-a-full-stack-designer-in-2017-will-you-be-one-7933a7145fb7), I will be continuing my role to develop the frontend portion (HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript).
