## The beginning

This is my umpteenth attempt at a blog but I'm pretty confident that this one will stick - it's on my personal website afterall. Ill be posting on stuff  It started almost a year ago on Oct 4th (just 2 days before my birthday). I was in the lecture theatre for a communications theory class in the afternoon when I got news that I got accepted into NUS Overseas College Silicon Valley 31st Batch bound for the Bay Area in Jan 2017. After a bunch of interviews with several companies (more on the process in another post), I was going to be the lead designer for Arch Systems (archsys.io). 

It has been 8 months since I got here (I've been putting off this project for a long time now but I guess it's not too late to start). I have learned a ton and do not regret taking 'a gap year' (no credits added to my graduation. 0. Nada. None) for this entire experience. 

I've been staying in the 'mansion' with 8 others and we call ourselves the Hillsboro Hobos - Anson, David, Kai Yi, Jay, Jaslyn, Valerie, Michelle, and Nicole - with the occasional 'Ho', Jeremy. We've been really fortunate to have found this place because its an amazing place central from all our workplaces, large enough space, and its based in Sunnyvale one of the safest and quietest cities in the bay area. No big problems so far, as long as you've got good management and setting down the rules. The most important aspects to me would be effective communication and respecting the place. 

Here's the highlight of our first half of the year.

Work has been pretty exciting. Being in an early stage startup and seeing it grow so much in the past few months has taught me a lot. Managing a full-time job, school projects/assignments, exploring opportunities, networking, and making the best of my time here has been hella tough - but like gold out of the fire, I think I can say that I'm more confident and prepared for the real world. 

California has been pretty darn amazing too with so much to **DO**, 

**SEE**, 

and **EAT**. 

I am definitely not regretting my decision of coming here.
