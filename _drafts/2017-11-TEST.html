      <h2> Arch Systems Website Expansion </h2>
      
      <h3 class="section animsition-link" id="projectinfo"> Project info and Problem statement</h3>
      <p> 
       As Arch continues to grow and have more customers in its pipeline, there is a crucial need to have more available information about what Arch does, the products and services we offer, and the value that we add. Arch's marketing website has a few pages but it does not clearly communicate all of the above which could lead to a potential loss in leads/sales if information is not readily available and easy to locate on the website. 
      </p>
      <p> Visit the website <a href="http://archsys.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

      <h3 class="section animsition-link" id=""> Goals / purpose  </h3>
      <p>
        Addressing the problem above, there is an urgent need to update the marketing website with relevant information / content and to invent a seamless flow for visitors to find that information in order to increase opportunities for leads and sales. 
      </p>

      <p>Goals would be: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Priority is to update the content in a coherent manner to communicate how far Arch has come and what we do. </li>
        <li> Make Arch products look high quality and well-established, and communicate our solutions are done, ready, and they work. However, we also do not want to overstate what we can do.</li>
        <li> Increase customer conversion rates through a seamless user experience to draw them to look at our products and services, and lead them to engage with us and become customers and partners of Arch.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I would be working closely with the business development team — Arch’s CEO and Cofounder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewscheuermann/" target="_blank">Andrew Scheuermann</a>, and the VP of Marketing, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tallis/" target="_blank">Tallis Blalack</a>, ffor the website expansion project. I will be taking on the role as the lead UX designer to conduct prior research, design mocks, and then code the pages out. We would take on a pseudo-Agile approach, going lean on the process due to time constraints.

      <p>
        Arch provides end-to-end IoT solutions targeting perational technology (OT) companies, both the OEMs (Original Equiment Manufacturers) of industrial equipment as well as the operators. 
      </p>

      <p>Our target audience would be: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          New prospects/customers who would like to know find out more about what Arch does and how we can create value with our products
          </li>
        <li> 
          Existing customers currently engaged in discussions with, to help them understand more about Arch’s solutions and to establish credibility. 
          </li>
        <li> 
          The broader community including our team members, family, public partnerships, and the media, to find out more about Arch and how we are working towards our vision for a more connected and sustainable Earth.

      <h3 class="section" id=""> Market/Competitive research and Best Practices  </h3>
      <p>
        Going into the space required a lot of understanding of the industries we are entering. I read and watched videos on the processes in the relevant industries such as shipping and logistics and outdoor agriculture to give me a better understanding of how we can show them value with Arch’s products. I also conducted research on our competition’s websites and learned by example on how they designed their websites and with that inspiration, brainstormed ideas to improve our current website.

      <h3 class="section" id=""> Persona development </h3>
      <p>
        With the target audience in mind, the first step to take was to understand the users. The research would play an important role to inform the layout of the pages to be built. As our process was lean, I instead read on the customers and companies currently engaged to develop a better understanding on their demographics. I then developed personas to fit into the frame of our target audience. 
        <br><br>
        Personas are a great reference to better understand the basic problems and needs of the audience. These provide a face/a person for the company to build products with. With the user in mind for every meeting, every decision, every design, and every line of code, it will produce a user-centered product that the end user will enjoy using and sees the value.

      <h3 class="section" id=""> Wireframes </h3>
      <p>
        The next step was to do up a bird’s eye view of the entire project as a guide to design the entire page. I did up a medium-fidelity wireframe of entire sitemap/project using a template for fast iteration. I used the wireframe to communicate my vision of the project and presented it to the business team, allowing me to proceed on with the project. We made the decision that the ‘Solutions’ part of the site was the first portion to be rolled out as it was highly implementable being high-level and as a first step be able to communicate the use cases to the customers we are talking to and to communicate to investors that we are making progress in various industries.

    <div class="box">
      <h3 class="section" id=""> Mock ups </h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I used Photoshop to design the website for the ’Solutions' portion of site. This was during a time when there was no design system in place and kept to a similar design style. I attempted to implement some sort of system in order to keep the work organized by color-coding the layers and adopting a simple naming convention. I made sure elements across the entire page retained a similar design as much as possible. Going lean, I did up only a few high-fidelity mock ups, exported it as images, and presented to the business team how these final pages would look like. The page layout and display of the information was given a go-ahead and then I proceeded to work on the rest of the pages. 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/mock1.png" alt="image-1" /><img class="example-image mb-sm"  src="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/mock1.png" alt="image-1" /></a>

      <p>
       Halfway through the project, I learned about design systems, implemented a very basic level of it, and switched over to using Sketch App as my primary design tool after picking up speed and proficiency in using it. I recreated the entire portion of the ‘Solutions’ pages in Sketch within a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        After implementing the design system, it was much easier to create new pages and it became a lot more organized in finding files and organizing layers. Not only was Sketch more useful with the ‘Symbols' function, the files were also light-weight and filled with many other great plugins to improve my workflow to suit the lean / agile process.

      <h3 class="section" id=""> Prototyping on Invision / Reiteration Cycles</h3>
      <p>
        Using the CRAFT plugin by Sketch, I was able to easily upload all artboards over to InVision much more conveniently and quicker within the app rather than manually adding the screens on the web app. 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="example-image mb-sm"  src="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision.png" alt="image-1" /></a>

      <p>
        Collection of the all artboards in an organized fashion with a standardized naming convention. 
        <br><br>
        InVision allows hotlinking of the artboards to make the prototype feel like a real app connecting pages. 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision3.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="example-image mb-sm"  src="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision3.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        Prior to InVision, the first few pages before the full website expansion project I developed at the start of the year were minimal where it did not require much reiteration. I would import the screens as images and ask for feedback through Google Docs, email, or as an attachment on Slack. I was putting on 2 hats (designer and frontend developer) at the same time while creating these pages. As a result, getting feedback for content was slow and inefficient as there was miscommunication and confusion in where the feedback was pointing at. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I revisited my process, realizing that the scale of this project was different — Having to design and develop 30+ pages, go through vigorous code review passes, and testing for production-ready pages takes up a huge amount of time. I had to find a more efficient way to gather feedback from the business team. To which, I read up on best practices and processes from other designers I networked with, from articles on Medium, and communities such as UX Designer Community, Product Tribe, and Designer Hangouts on Slack channels on their design and reiteration processes and their approach working with a team. With my learnings, I took up one role at a time (Designer, and then Developer), and minced the process — 1) UX research 2) Design 3) Reiteration 4) Develop. I introduced InVision, a powerful prototyping tool, to the business team as a platform to provide feedback — compared to taking images of each screen and requesting for feedback. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the screens were all linked and functioned just like an actual website, I would share the ready prototype to the business team. Feedback on specific areas of the page are communicated clearer which resulted in faster iteration cycles and a more agile process.
      </p>

    <div class="box">
      <h3 class="section" id=""> Development</h3>
      <p>
          Once the design and content has been confirmed, the next step was to 'change hats’ to that of a web developer to code out the new pages. I would then gather all assets from the high-fidelity mocks for the website — processed images, custom CSS styles, icons etc. With everything I need for the website in hand, I then begin went on to make the ‘modular pieces’ and ‘templates’ which consists of similar chunks of code (but differing content) thanks to Jekyll, a Ruby-based static page generator, that makes use of tags in Front Matter and custom variables (Liquid) which I had implemented on the website modular (easy to change things like header and footer across all the website). 
      </p>
      <p>
        After the pages are coded out, I would make sure that the page is responsive for mobile and meta descriptions and keywords are suitable for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) best practices before proceeding to test on a staging server and then releasing for production.

        We were able to produce the first set of pages, ‘Solutions’ and ‘IOTile' out and have been working on the next batch of webpages for release. 
        There were immediate results since the release of the ’Solution' pages on Google Analytics since August where these new pages account for 20.67% of the total visits since the release. The ‘IOTile / Product’ pages account for 58.92% of total views at the end of the week of release.
