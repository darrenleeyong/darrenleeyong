      <h2> Red Cross Youth NUS. </h2>
      <p> 
        This is my first web design project after picking up 
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/learn/v4/overview" target="_blank" >basic frontend knowledge (HTML and CSS)</a>
         over the summer of 2015. 
        I took on this project with the limited knowledge that I had and experimented with design aspects but along the requirements of the client and managed to craft a website based on what I learned over summer.

      <h2>Overall a good learning experience. </h2>
      <p>
        It was a great opportunity for me to quickly apply what I have learned over the summer. 
        With severals hour of practice, I was able to familiarise myself with basic website structure and then express my creativity.
        Overall, this was my first big step that set me on my path as a designer.
