                <!--<p> 
                  Hello again! My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenleeyong/" target="_blank" class="link-no-ul">Darren Lee</a>. 
                  I am a Product/UX designer and 
                  <span class="tippytooltip" title="Expected graduation: December 2018">a final year</span> 
                  Communications and New Media student at the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/global/rankings.html" target="_blank" class="link-no-ul">National University of Singapore</a>. 
                  I am studying full-time and doing a part-time internship at <a href="http://ibm.com/ibmix" target="_blank" class="link-no-ul">IBM iX</a> as a UX Designer (Intern). 
                  <br>

                  <br> Growing up, I have always been intrigued by how things worked. That curiosity transformed into a desire to explore a myriad of areas such as    
                  <a href="/dist/images/darren-failure-resume-09-18.pdf" target="_blank">biomedical sciences, economics, and programming</a>. Eventually, I found UX design, where my interests and skills coincide. 
                  As a UX designer, I ask questions to get to the root of the problem, use data to make informed decisions, add creativity and attention to detail into every interaction &mdash; all for an immersive end-to-end experience for my users.    
                  <br>

                  <br> In my free time, I enjoy reading articles about design, entrepreneurship, and life on Medium, listening to classical and EDM music, learning new languages (currently <span class="tippytooltip" title="„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ!">Japanese</span> and <span class="tippytooltip" title="ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî!">Korean</span>), and meeting new people over ‚òïÔ∏è. If you want to get in touch or learn more about what I do, feel free to <a href="mailto:darrenlee@u.nus.edu" target="_blank">drop me an email!</a>
