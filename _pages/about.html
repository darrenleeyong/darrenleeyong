                  Hello! My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenleeyong/" target="_blank" class="link-no-ul">Darren Lee</a>. 
                  I am a UX designer as well as a final year Communications and New Media student at <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/global/rankings.html" target="_blank" class="link-no-ul">National University of Singapore</a> (expected graduation: December 2018). 
                  This summer, I will be working at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/seagrp/" target="_blank" class="link-no-ul">Sea Labs</a> as a UX/UI Designer (Intern) on a wide range of platforms, translating high-level business requirements into tangible user interfaces.
                  <br>

                  <br> As a kid, I have always been intrigued by how things worked and enjoyed brainstorming ways to improve existing processes. That curiosity transformed into a hunger to explore a myriad of new experiences. After having tried out various fields such as    
                  <a href="../darren-failure-resume-11-17.pdf" target="_blank">biomedical science, economics, and computing</a>, I finally found the perfect fit where passion, interests, and skill coincide - a UX designer. 
                  <br>

                  <br> As a UX designer, I combine a user-centered approach, data-driven methodologies, and creativity into problem-solving to develop an understanding of the issue at its core allowing teams to build a product that creates value to its users. 
                  <br>

                  <br> In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, learning new languages (currently Japanese and Korean), and meeting new people over ‚òïÔ∏è.
 
                  <br>
                  
                  <br> If you want to get in touch or learn more about what I do, feel free to <a href="mailto:darrenlee@u.nus.edu" target="_blank">drop me an email!</a>
