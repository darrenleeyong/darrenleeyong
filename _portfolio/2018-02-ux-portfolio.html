      <h3 class="section" id="bginfo"> Background Information</h3>
      <p> 
       Since last year, I've been seeking a summer internship (2018) in the Bay Area to further improve my technical skills, to pick up best practices, and mentorship from senior designers. 
       The design portfolio is a tool to market a designers' skill and is usually necessary for design job applications.
       As I was searching up on how to start, I stumbled upon this quote on a <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/creating-a-design-portfolio/" target="_blank">blog post on InVision</a> —  <b>‘Treat creating your portfolio like any other design project you’d take on’.</b>
       <br><br>
       <span>A thought jolted in my mind — ‘Couldn’t <b>my design portfolio</b> be a <b>UX project?</b>’</span>
       <br><br>

       ...and let’s take a look at how I can apply the same principles into my portfolio to present my design process: <br><br>

       <br>
        
      </p>

      <p>
        Yup, it is definitely possible to turn my portfolio into a UX piece. A good portfolio communicates why one is a valuable candidate and it takes work to build one - and a <b>GREAT</b> portfolio requires careful preparation, a lot of research, testing, and then tons of iteration. 
      </p>

      <p>
        For most UX projects, a UX designer is designing for a client/ organization — This project is for design students looking for design internships (inserting myself into context). 
      </p>

      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <p>
        Like all goals, they have to measurable, realistic, and achievable. 
        <br><br>
        As such, my goal is <b>‘to craft an impressive portfolio for design students that is visually pleasing, impresses recruiters, and communicates value and low risk - by the end of February’. </b>
      </p>

      <h4>Questions for testing:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> Will the portfolio be able to demonstrate the capabilities of the student? </li>
        <li> Will the portfolio be deemed good by other designers? </li>
        <li> Will adding something 'unique' make a mark? </li>
        <li> <b>and finally, is my portfolio good enough that people want to talk to me?</b></li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4>Role</h4>
      <p>
        I wore all kinds of hats for this project — from developing the site, to designing the art pieces, and writing the case. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="section" id="research">Research</h3>
          <h4>Target audience</h4>
          <p>
            Like every UX project, a target audience is identified and understood - their processes in getting a job done, pain points, variables involved in each step etc. 
            <br></br>
            <b>Design recruiters</b> are my target audience as the goal is to acquire an internship.
          </p>

          <br><br>
          <p>    
          I interviewed my mom, <b>a HR manager</b>, about the decision-making process in hiring. Hiring practices/decisions varies across companies but a typical flow is where recruiters will do a primary screening through their resume (and/or portfolio) and forward shortlisted candidates to a hiring manager. Next, these hiring managers will conduct interviews to assess the abilities of the candidate, which can be a single round or multiple rounds of screening. Finally, if a candidate is deemed fit for a position, a board of people would make the decision of offering the position (<b>the goal</b>). 
          <br><br>

          </p>
          
          <h4>User Research</h4>
          <p>
            Next was to learn what they looked out for in a potential candidate. Fortunately, I stumbled upon an article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/what-do-you-want-to-see-in-my-ux-design-portfolio-fc98dc48c01" target="_blank">interviewing 20 experienced designers from various tech companies on what they would like to see in a portfolio</a>.
          </p>

          <i>Really good article for any designer who wants to improve on their portfolio</i><br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            <b>Summarizing what they look out for (not in any order): </b>
            <br><br>
            Typically more than 3 pieces of previous work that: 
            <ol>
              <li> Showcase their technical skills on CV (good skill fit for a role in their company), </li>
              <li> Shows succinct communication and great understanding of the problem, </li>
              <li> Demonstrates design / decision-making process (The ‘Why?’ at every step of the project), </li>
              <li> Tells your creative problem-solving askills and the impact you made with your solution,</li>
              <li> Their design knowledge and foundations (color theory, typography etc), </li>
              <li> Whether they are a good fit in their company culture. </li>
            </ol> 
          </p>

          <p>
          The best way to make a good portfolio was learning from good examples as benchmarks and then implementing.
          <br><br>
          There were many good portfolios on the web but the one that was most relevant was, <a href="http://cofolios.com" target="_blank">cofolios</a> (created by Hasque, props to you for this was really really useful!), 
          which showcased portfolios of <b>former design interns at big tech companies</b>. It was an excellent point of reference to gauge how much more work I had to put in.

      <h3 class="section" id="mvportfolio"> Minimum Viable Portfolio (MVP) </h3>
      
         <p>
           I challenged myself and not use a site builder like Squarespace or Wix to build my portfolio. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, consisting of reusable components (header/footer), and powerful plugins, were used. I won't go into too much detail on how I build it (probably for a future blog post). I also added Google Analytics and SmartLook to collect visitor data and understand how the users interact/behave on my website.
         </p>
          <br>
        <p>
          Reflection (finding the balance): I had a tough time deciding between calling it ‘done’/ minimum-viable for me to start user testing. But on hindsight, I realized that the earlier you get feedback/data, iterations are more efficient. 
        <br><br>
          
          <h4>Resume</h4>
          <p>
            If there’s one thing that I had been working on for the longest time ever, it would be my resume. I would gather feedback and make iterations over and over again. Looking at resumes from others inspired a cleaner and succinct look on my own.

          <h4>'Resume of Failure' / Unique Piece</h4>
          <p>
            Last summer, I read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/B00UVY52JO/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1518747453&sr=8-3&keywords=elon+musk" target="_blank">autobiography of Elon Musk by Ashley Vince</a>. 
            His numerous shortcomings and setbacks made him who he was today. I was inspired to craft my own ‘resume of failures’ of missed opportunities and failed accomplishments along my journey.

          <p>
          Here comes the most exciting part - observing to see if my MVP answered the questions I set earlier on. 
          <br><br>
          I targeted the design community for my testing and shared my portfolio to various design communities on Slack for design & product including Designers Hangout, UXDC, Designership, Product School, Product Tribe etc.
          <br><br>
          
          <i>Various communities for design and product on Slack. </i><br>
          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/ux_portfolio/slack.png">
          <br><br>
          I then shared it to a Facebook group with more than ~16,000 members, HH design.  
          <br><br>

          <i>Crafted my communication strategically with purpose and intent, while requesting for feedback to improve. (Also marketing that I’m looking for an internship). </i>

        <h4>Resume of failures </h4>
        <p>
          Many people feedback and commented that they really liked the ‘resume of failures’. It definitely left a mark and there’s not too much that needs to be changed.

          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/ux_portfolio/constructivefeedback.png">
          <br>
          I have gotten a lot of constructive feedback from the community on how to further improve my portfolio and what people are looking out for.

          <br><br>

        <h3>Google Analytics </h3>

          66.47% from US, 12.4% from Canada, ~4% from India, ~3% from UK. 
          A few from Singapore, France, Sweden, Spain, Malaysia. 
          On the far end of the spectrum with 1 visitor, Egypt, Israel, and Ireland.

        <br>
        This is a heat map generated by Smartlook after a 1000 visits have been logged (free up to a 1000). The website has served it’s purpose with people clicking on the portfolio button, my blog, and my resume. I repeated the (CTA)call to action of clicking on my resume below my description upon landing. Most hottest area was my resume of failure followed by my resume (the little animation from wow.js has helped in increasing interactions).

      <h3 class="section" id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
          <h4>Looking back at the questions I have set for testing:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li> Will the portfolio be able to demonstrate the capabilities of the student? </li>
            <li> Will the portfolio be deemed good by other designers? </li>
            <li> Will adding something 'unique' make a mark? </li>
            <li> <b>and finally, is my portfolio good enough that people want to talk to me?</b></li>
          </ol>
          <br>

          <p>
          With the data that I have gathered, my portfolio definitely needs brushing up on certain aspects as per the feedback suggested. 
          But the data collected also pointed out the portfolio is fairly decent as per the design community and it does communicate my design process. 
          <br><br> 
          Is my portfolio good enough that people will talk to me? <b>Yes.</b> The big question of this project is validated and this shows that I have indeed make heads turned. 
          <br><br> 
          The Resume of Failures was an overwhelming success with lots of positive feedback saying they liked it a lot! 
          <br><br> 
          ‘Will recruiters hire me?’ - Well, the summer application period is an ongoing process, and a big part of it is waiting ...
          <br><br> 
          I would like to thank the extremely supportive design community for their help to make this piece possible. (It’s the community that makes learning more accessible from one another.)

    <div class="box">
      <h3 class="section" id="donebetter">What could I have done better?</h3>
      <p>
         While the data collected was significant for answering the questions that I have set, I lacked qualitative data from real design recruiters, who were my main audience. 
         The lack of resources in contacting them and scheduling for an interview or even just a review of my portfolio is logistically challenging even though there are resources like LinkedIn where I can talk to recruiters, 
         the drawback however is that it is time-consuming and has low chance of someone getting back to me.
         <br><br>
         The data collected was mostly quantitative from the nature of testing, and with that I should have conducted A/B testing where users/visitors will reach different landing pages containing different Call To Actions.
         Right now, there are 2 main CTAs (Resume and Resume of Failures), so I could definitely tell if the <b>'Resume of Failure'</b> has a higher (Click Through Rate) CTR than the <b>'Resume'</b> with data rather than inferring from just a heatmap.
         <br><br>
         I would share my portfolio to <b>non-designers</b> too, just to understand the effects of my experiments outside my target audience.
