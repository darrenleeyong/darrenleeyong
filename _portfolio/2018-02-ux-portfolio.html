      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> I was looking for an internship for Summer 2018 and wanted to build an impressive portfolio for my applications
        <br><br>
        <b>Opportunity:</b> Applying design thinking methodology in my internship applications using research and analytics to inform my design decisions.
        <br><br>
        <b>Impact:</b> My portfolio improved and I successfully got an internship! (became the first design intern in Sea Group’s R&D at Sea Labs in Summer 2018.)

        <!--I applied design thinking methodology in my internship applications for Summer 2018. <b>I first broke down the recruiting process to find out what companies are looking out for in candidates and set design goals</b>. I then researched best practices and examples of impressive portfolios and designed my portfolio according to those requirements. Lastly, I shared my portfolio to designers and recruiters for feedback while measuring the effectiveness of my new portfolio via analytics before sending out applications. <b>I became the first design intern in Sea Group’s R&D at Sea Labs in Summer 2018. </b>-->

      <p> 
       I've been seeking for a summer internship (2018) to further improve my design skills and for mentorship. 
       The design portfolio is used to market a designers' skills and is usually necessary for job applications.
       When I was searching up on how to start, I stumbled upon this quote on a <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/creating-a-design-portfolio/" target="_blank">blog post on InVision</a> —  
       <i>‘Treat creating your portfolio like any other design project you’d take on’.</i>
       <br><br>
       ...
       <span><i>‘Isn't my <b>design portfolio a UX project?</b>’</i></span>

        A look at the components of a UX project:<br><br>

       <br><br>
       ... a look at how the same principles can be applied to present my design process: <br><br>

       <br>
        
      </p>

      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <p>
        My goal for this project was <b>to craft an impressive portfolio that impresses recruiters and communicates value and low risk in hiring me. </b>
      <br><br>
      </p>

      <h4>Questions to test:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> Will I be able to demonstrate the capabilities of the student? </li>
        <li> Does adding something 'unique' make an impact? </li>
        <li> <b>Is my portfolio good enough that people want to talk to me?</b></li>
      </ol>
      <br>

          <h4>Target audience</h4>
          <p>
          <b>Recruiters/HR Associates</b> are my target audience. I dug out their pain points identified in each step of the hiring process 
          through an interview with <b>a HR manager</b>. Hiring practices/decisions varies across companies but a typical flow is where 
          <span class="tippytooltip" title="through their resume and/or portfolio">primary screening is conducted</span> and shortlisted candidates are forwarded to a hiring manager. 
          These hiring managers conduct interviews to 
          <span class="tippytooltip" title="which can be a single or multiple rounds. ">assess the candidate.</span> 
          If a candidate is suitable, a board would finalize the decision of an offer. 
          <br><br>

          </p>
          
          <h4>User Research</h4>
          <p>
            Next was to find out what recruiters look out for in a potential candidate. 
            Fortunately, I stumbled upon an article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/what-do-you-want-to-see-in-my-ux-design-portfolio-fc98dc48c01" target="_blank">
            interviewing 20 experienced designers on what they want to see in a portfolio</a>.

          <p>
            <b>Summarizing what they look out for: </b>
            <br><br>
            Typically more than 3 pieces of previous work that: 
            <ol>
              <li> Showcase their technical skills on CV, </li>
              <li> Shows succinct communication and great understanding of the problem, </li>
              <li> Demonstrates design/decision-making process (the ‘Why?’ at every step), </li>
              <li> Tells your creative problem-solving askills and the impact you made with your solution,</li>
              <li> Their design knowledge and foundations, </li>
              <li> Whether they are a good fit in their company culture. </li>

          <p>
          The best way to make a good portfolio was learning from benchmarks and implementing what worked for them.
          I found a website <a href="http://cofolios.com" target="_blank">cofolios</a>, 
          which showcased portfolios of <b>former design interns at big tech companies</b>, 
          which was an excellent point of reference.

           <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" class="tippytooltip" title=" Ruby-based static page generator that makes use of reusable components and powerful plugins">Jekyll</a>. 
           I also added Google Analytics and SmartLook to collect visitor data and understand how the users interact/behave on my website.

          <h4>Resume</h4>
          <p>
            I spent a great deal of time perfecting my resume where I made tons of iterations. I referred to resumes of past interns for inspiration and developed a cleaner look for my own.

            Last summer, I read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/B00UVY52JO/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1518747453&sr=8-3&keywords=elon+musk" target="_blank">autobiography of Elon Musk by Ashley Vince</a>, which inspired me to craft my own

            documenting missed opportunities and failures along my journey.

          It was time to test if my portfolio answered the questions I set. 
          I shared my portfolio to various design communities/channels on Slack including Designers Hangout and UX Design Community. I also shared it to HH Design, a Facebook group with more than ~16,000 members.

        <p>
          I excluded my own IP address to prevent my own visits from being added to the analytics.

          <br><br>

        <h4>Geography: </h4>
        <p>
          66.47% of visitors from the US, 12.4% from Canada, ~4% from India, ~3% from UK. 
          A few from Singapore, France, Sweden, Spain, Malaysia. 
          On the far end of the spectrum with 1 visitor, Egypt, Israel, and Ireland.

        <h4>Page Views </h4>

        The main page has the most views followed by my piece on 'StaffAny Design Sprint' followed by the 'Arch Design System' pieces were probably the most interesting pieces.

        This is a heat map generated by Smartlook after a 1000 visits have been logged. The website has served it’s purpose with people clicking on the portfolio button, my blog, and my resume. 
        I repeated the CTA of clicking on my resume below my description upon landing. 
        The most hottest area was my resume of failure followed by my resume (animations probably helped in increasing interactions). <br>

          <br><br> 
          <i>"Is my portfolio good enough that people will talk to me?"</i> <b>Yes.</b> I have indeed make heads turned with emails and messages coming in after.

          <br><br> 
          The Resume of Failures was a success with lots of positive feedback saying they liked it a lot! I really appreciate the extremely supportive design community for their help to make this piece possible. (It’s the community that makes learning more accessible from one another.)

      <h3 class="section" id="donebetter">What could I have done better?</h3>
      <p>
         While the data collected was significant for answering the questions that I have set, I lacked qualitative data from actual design recruiters. 
         The approach I took meant I couldn't tell who was reviewing my portfolio. It is logistically challenging to reach out to recruiters, 
         and there is a low chance of someone getting back to me due to a recruiter's busy schedule.
         <br><br>
         The data collected was mostly quantitative from the nature of testing. I should have conducted A/B testing where visitors will reach different landing pages containing different Call To Actions.
         Right now, there are 
         <span class="tippytooltip" title="To view my Resume and Resume of Failures">2 main CTAs</span>, so I could tell if the <b>'Resume of Failure'</b> had a higher Click-Through Rate than <b>'Resume'</b>.
         <br><br>
         I would share my portfolio to <b>non-designers</b> as well to get opinions outside the design community.
