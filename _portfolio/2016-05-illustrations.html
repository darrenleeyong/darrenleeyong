       Pictures paint a thousand words. I had always been intrigued by illustrations but did not really dare dwell in an area I was weak at. It was only recently during my 2018 summer internship at Sea Labs where I got inspired 
       by <a href="https://www.behance.net/linfengshe" target="_blank"> my mentor, Qian Ji Dong</a>, who taught me closely how to use colors and shapes to design beautiful illustrations. I began practicing to improve my visual design sense and skills and this page will showcase my future work. I will eventually have my work up on Behance and Dribbble.

        My very first piece. Started out as practice but got caught in the process and continued the piece. The idea was inspired by my upcoming road trip to visit Yellowstone. Designed in Sketch.
