      <p> 
       As Arch continues adding more customers / pilots in its pipeline, we have to communicate succinctly what we do, present all available information such as the products / services offered, and demonstrate the value it brings. The marketing website has a few pages but it does not inform, which could lead to a potential loss in leads/sales.

      <p>
        Going into the space required a lot of understanding of the industries. Due to limitations such as inability to conduct interviews with the operations, I conducted inferential research via resources on the web. I learned the processes within the relevant industries such as shipping and logistics to gain a better understanding of how we can demonstrate value with Arch’s products. I also conducted research on our competitors through their websites, observed the layout of their websites, analyzed and drew insights to see what worked and what did not, and brainstormed for ideas for the new pages.

      <p>
        Research played an important role to inform the way we build the pages. I read on the customers and companies we are currently engaged with to develop a better understanding on their demographics. I then developed personas to fit into the frame of our target audience. 
        <br><br>
        Personas are great reference points to better understand the basic problems and needs of the audience. ‘Tom’ is 'a person' that Arch can refer to to build a better product — for every meeting, every decision, every design, and every line of code.

      <h3 class="section" id="wireframes"> Wireframes </h3>
      <p>
        The next step was to get a bird’s eye view of the project as a guide. I did low-fidelity sketches, and then moved to a medium-fidelity wireframe of the entire sitemap to visualize the flow of a user and presented it to the business team, allowing me to proceed on with the project. We made the decision that the ‘Solutions’ pages were priority and will be the first portion to be rolled out as it was highly implementable and as a first step be able to show use cases. Followed by the 'IOTile / Product' pages and then finally the front page.

      <h3 class="section" id="mockups"> Mock ups </h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I used Photoshop to design the website for the ’Solutions' pages - before a design system was in place. I attempted to implement some sort of consistency / style and kept the work organized by color-coding the layers and adopting a simple naming convention. Going lean, I did a few high-fidelity mock ups and presented to the business team how these final pages would look like. The page layout and display of the information was given a go-ahead and then I proceeded to work on the rest of the branch.
      </p>
      <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/mock1.png" alt="image-1" /><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/mock1.png" alt="image-1" /></a>

      <p>
       Halfway through, I implemented a very basic level of a design system and switched over to Sketch App as my primary tool after picking up speed and proficiency in it. I manage to recreate the entire portion of the ‘Solutions’ pages in Sketch within a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       After implementing the design system, it was much easier to create new pages and it became a lot more organized in finding files and organizing layers. Not only was Sketch more useful with the ‘Symbols' function, the files were also light-weight and offered many great plugins to improve my workflow to suit the lean / agile process.

      <h3 class="section" id="prototyping"> Prototyping on Invision / Reiteration Cycles</h3>
      <p>
        Using the <b>CRAFT plugin by Sketch</b>, I was able to conveniently upload all artboards to InVision within the app as opposed to manually adding the screens on the web app. 
      </p>
      <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision.png" ><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        I organized my artboards into collections with a standardized naming convention. 
      </p>
      <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision2.png" ><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision2.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        InVision allows hotlinking of the artboards to make the prototype feel like a real app connecting pages. 
      </p>
      <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision3.png" ><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision3.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        Prior to InVision and before the expansion project, development of early pages initially were minimal as it did not require much reiteration. I would present already coded screens and ask for feedback through Google Docs, email, or as an attachment on Slack. As a result, getting feedback for content was slow and inefficient as there was miscommunication and confusion in where the feedback was pointing at. Furthermore, I was putting on 2 hats (designer and frontend developer) at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scale of this project was different — Designing many more pages, vigorous code reviews, and testing for production-ready pages would take up a huge amount of time. I revisited my process and had to find a more efficient way of gathering feedback. I gained inspiration from designers I networked with, learned best practices from reading articles on Medium, and picked up tips and valuable advice from communities such as UX Designer Community, Product Tribe, and Designer Hangouts and their approach for working agile with a team. With what I have learned, I minced my process into smaller digestable chunks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I introduced InVision, a powerful prototyping tool, to the business team as a platform for feedback and the result was that feedback on specific areas of the page are demarcated clearer, which resulted in efficient iteration cycles compared to the previous method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the design and content was completed, I changed to my 'web designer hat’. All assets from the high-fidelity mocks are gathered — compressed images, custom CSS styles, icons etc, and I code out 'molecules’ which are like 'modules' a feature of Jekyll, a Ruby-based static page generator, that makes use of tags in Front Matter and custom variables (Liquid) which I implemented (easier to change content like the header and footer across the entire website).
      </p>
      <p>
        After the pages are completed, responsiveness testing for mobile and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is done as the final part of the process by before proceeding to test for deployment on a staging server before releasing for production.

        We were able to produce the a few set of pages — ‘Solutions’, ‘IOTile', and a new front page and have been working on the next batch of webpages or improving all aspects. 
        
      </p>

      <P>
        There were immediate results since the release of the ’Solution' pages on Google Analytics since August where these new pages account for 20.67% of the total visits since the release.

      <P>
         The ‘IOTile / Product’ pages account for 58.92% of total views at the end of the week of release. 
        We also have a new front page that better explains what we do. The website is ever-evolving and continual improvements are expected as Arch continues to expand.

      <p>
         While I have done formal research on the requirements of the project, I lacked severely in quantity of feedback as I was only receiving feedback about the site from mostly the business team as I sought to design for their needs. 
         Even if our main target audience of prospects / customers and existing customers was hard to acquire for testing. 
         <br><br>
         For implementation, I did learn new tools to prototype faster and new ways of gathering feedback which helped me gain speed in delivering. However, more best practices with these tools could be applied such as naming convetions and providing a guideline for feedback to my team as the information was a little over the place.
