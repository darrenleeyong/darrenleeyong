      <h2> Arch Systems Website Expansion </h2>
      
      <h3>Project info and Problem statement</h3>
      <p> 
       As Arch continue to expand and add more customers in the sales pipeline, there is a crucial need to have more available information about what Arch does as a company, the products and services we offer, and the value that we add. Arch's marketing website has a few pages but it does not clearly communicate all of the above which could lead to a potential loss in leads/sales if information is not readily available and easy to locate on the website.

      <h3>Goals / purpose  </h3>
      <p>
        Addressing the problem above, there is a need to update the marketing website with relevant information/content and to invent a seamless flow for visitors to find that information in order to increase opportunities for leads and sales. Expanding the website with all the information is a big project and requires careful planning. For a project of this scale, there is a need to build the website with the user’s thought process in mind. Adopting the right user-centered strategy while accounting for the right way to paint a picture of our vision for a more connected and sustainable world.  
      </p>

      <p>The goals for implementing a common language between all teams (design, business, and development) is to ensure the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Top priority is to update the content in a coherent manner to communicate how far we have come and succinct. </li>
        <li> Make Arch product line look high quality and well-established, and that our solutions are done, ready, and they work. However, at the same time, we do not want to overstate what we can do. </li>
        <li> Increase customer conversion rates through a seamless user experience to draw them to look at our products and services, and lead them to engage with us and become customers and partners of Arch.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I would be working closely with the business development team — Arch’s CEO and Cofounder, Andrew Scheuermann, and the VP of Marketing, Tallis Blalack, for the website expansion project. I will be taking on the role as the lead UX designer to do user research, design out the website, and then code it out. We would take on a pseudo-Agile approach, going lean on the development process due to time constraints. </p>

      <h3>Market/Competitive research and Best Practices  </h3>
      <p>
        Going into the space required a lot of understanding of the industries we are entering. I read and watched videos on the processes in the relevant industries such as shipping and logistics and outdoor agriculture to give me a better understanding of how we can show them value with Arch’s products. I also conducted research on our competition’s websites and learned by example on how they designed their websites and with that inspiration, brainstormed ideas to improve our current website.

      <h3>UX research / Persona development and Case Studies </h3>
      <p>
        With the target audience in mind, the first step to take was to understand the users and to conduct research. The research would play an important role to inform the layout of the pages to be built. As our process was lean, I instead read on the customers and companies currently engaged to develop a better understanding on their demographics. I then developed personas to fit into the frame of our target audience. 
        <br><br>
        Personas are a great reference to better understand the basic problems and needs of the audience. These provide a face/a person for the company to build products with. With the user in mind for every meeting, every decision, every design, and every line of code, it will produce a user-centered product that the end user will enjoy using and sees the value.

      <h3>Wireframes </h3>
      <p>
        The next step was to do up a bird’s eye view of the entire project as a guide to design the entire page. I did up a medium-fidelity wireframe of entire sitemap/project using a template for fast iteration. I used the wireframe to communicate my vision of the project and presented it to the business team, allowing me to proceed on with the project. We made the decision that the ‘Solutions’ part of the site was the first portion to be rolled out as it was highly implementable being high-level and as a first step be able to communicate the use cases to the customers we are talking to and to communicate to investors that we are making progress in various industries.

      <h3>Mock ups </h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I used Photoshop to design the website for the ’Solutions' portion of site. This was during a time when there was no design system in place and kept to a similar design style. I attempted to implement some sort of system in order to keep the work organized by color-coding the layers and adopting a simple naming convention. I made sure elements across the entire page retained a similar design as much as possible. Going lean, I did up only a few high-fidelity mock ups, exported it as images, and presented to the business team how these final pages would look like. The page layout and display of the information was given a go-ahead and then I proceeded to work on the rest of the pages. 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/mock1.png" alt="image-1" /><img class="example-image" src="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/mock1.png" alt="image-1" /></a>

      <p>
        Halfway through the project, I learned about design systems, implemented a very basic level of it, and switched over to using Sketch App as my primary design tool after picking up speed and proficiency in using it. I recreated the entire portion of the ‘Solutions’ pages in Sketch within a day (renamed to ‘Applications’).
      </p>
      <p>
        After implementing the design system, it was much easier to create new pages and it became a lot more organized in finding files and organizing layers. Not only was Sketch more useful with the ‘Symbols' function, the files were also light-weight and filled with many other great plugins to improve my workflow to suit the lean / agile process.

      <h3>Prototyping on Invision / Reiteration cycles</h3>
      <p>
        Using the CRAFT plugin by Sketch, I was able to easily upload all artboards over to InVision much more conveniently and quicker within the app rather than manually adding the screens on the web app. 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="example-image" src="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision2.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="example-image" src="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision2.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        Collection of the all the artboards and screens in an organized fashion with a standardized naming convention. 
        InVision allows hotlinking of the artboards to make the prototype feel like a real app connecting pages. 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision3.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="example-image" src="/images/portfolio/arch_web_expansion/invision3.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        Prior to InVision, the first few pages extra pages before the full website expansion project I developed at the start of the year were minimal. It did not require too much reiteration and I put on 2 hats (designer and frontend developer) at the same time while creating these pages. I would import the screens as images and ask for feedback through Google Docs, email, or as an attachment on Slack. As a result, getting feedback for content was slow and inefficient as there was miscommunication and confusion in where the feedback was pointing at. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I revisited my process, realizing that the scale of this project was way too large — Having to design and develop 30+ pages to and having to go through vigorous code review passes and testing for production-ready pages already takes up a huge amount of time. I had to find another way to approach gathering feedback from the business team. To which, I read up on best practices and processes from other designers I networked with, from articles on Medium, and communities such as UX Designer Community, Product Tribe, and Designer Hangouts on Slack channels on their design and reiteration processes and how their approach on working with a team. With my learnings, I took on a different approach, took up one role at a time (Designer, and then Developer), and made it a process — 1) UX research 2) Design 3) Reiteration 4) Develop. I introduced InVision, a powerful prototyping tool, to the business team as a platform to provide feedback rather than the old-fashioned way of taking images of each and every screen and requesting for feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the screens were all properly linked and functions just like an actual website, I would share a link with the ready prototype on InVision to the business team. Feedback on specific areas of the page are communicated clearer which resulted in faster iteration cycles and a more agile product development process.

      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>
          Once the design and content has been confirmed, the next step was to 'change hats’ to that of a web developer to code out the new pages. I would then gather all assets from the high-fidelity mocks for the website — processed images, CSS styles, icons etc. With everything I need for the website in hand, I then begin went on to make the ‘modular pieces’ and ‘templates’ which consists of similar chunks of code (but differing content) thanks to Jekyll, a Ruby-based static page generator, that makes use of tags in Front Matter and custom variables (Liquid) which I had implemented on the website earlier on - modular (easy to change things like header and footer across all the website).
      </p>
      <p>
        After the pages are done up, I would make sure that the page is responsive for mobile views and meta descriptions and keywords are suitable for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) best practices and then proceed to test on a staging server before releasing for production.

      <h3>Results and Success</h3>
      <p>
        We are able to produce the first set of pages ‘Solutions’ out and have been working on the next batch of webpages for release. There is apparent results since the release of these pages on Google Analytics since August where these new pages account for 26.13% of the total visits since the release.
