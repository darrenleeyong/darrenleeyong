      <p> 
        Second Hackathon at 
        <a href="http://hackfestsg.com/" target="_blank" > Hackfest Hackathon.</a> 
        This hackathon was on a larger scale and had more focus on tech. 
        Competition was really tough and judging criteria was fairly different.
        Our product was 'Percusso' - an analytic tool for music makers where users will critique and comment on different parts of the song.

      <h2> Hackathons are fun and great for learning. </h2>
      <p>
        Despite the 
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5302940" target="_blank" > controversy of hackathons,</a>
        I still think that hackathons are a great avenue to think out of the box, apply creativity in problem solving and a test of your limits. 
        If you want to learn more about group dynamics, get ideas and inspiritation, and know your skill level, hackathons are just the place to be at.
