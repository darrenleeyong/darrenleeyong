      <h3 class="section " id="project"> Project info and Problem statement</h3>
      <p> 
       I joined Arch Systems as their first designer (intern) to improve the company's branding, customer-facing products, and overall customer experience. After using the mobile app, web app, and marketing website, I realized that there were inconsistencies — colors, typography, UI, grids etc. There was a need to set up a design language to build the foundation for a more consistent design across all products, and a scaffold to build upon — all via a design system.

      <p>
       A design system with proper documentation and easy-to-iterate assets aims to solve the problem of inconsistency across all products and provide a library for both designers and developers to rapidly prototype new designs to production without redesigning / recreating custom designs each time. 
        <br><br>
        As Arch's first designer, I implemented Arch's design strategy from the ground up. Elements of the design systems includes (and is not limited to) color palettes, typography, icon families, grid layouts, design principles, high-fidelity UI pattern library, brand guidelines, and code snippets. I worked closely with the frontend engineer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanielle-lee-35662a87/" target="_blank">Vanielle Le</a>, to help with the frontend technicalities.

      <p>
        The goals for implementing a common language between all teams is to ensure the following: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Improved consistency in design enhances overall user experience for Arch’s product suite to reduce confusion and clutter.  </li>
        <li> Improvement in branding; increased recognizability, tone of voice, etc. </li>
        <li> Business: Reference and template — language (common vocabulary) in marketing messages and marketing collateral.</li>
        <li> Design: Reliable and reusable system — efficient in making new assets, and not waste time redesigning similar assets.</li>
        <li> Software and Hardware: Aids in UI/UX design decisions in development. </li>

        The design system is primarily for internal use where all users should be able to pick up the system with ease, and be able to focus on the work they need to do, without the need to make design decisions or search for design assets.

      <p>
        Not having implemented a design system before, I picked up the best practices from big companies such as Airbnb, Facebook, Yelp, Salesforce etc.A bulk of my learning came from reading off Medium — a completely overlooked, rich treasure trove of knowledge where I found high-quality articles and guides for implementing design systems and all other things. These articles are written by experienced and talented designers that made the understanding the concepts, picking up the know-hows of the design system, and detailed steps to quick implementation possible.

      <h3 class="section " id="documentation"> Documentation and Organization </h3>
      <p>
        The distinction between a good designer and a great designer is how they organize their tools for their work. 'Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe’ — is a how I would describe organization to a designer. Documentation and organization is there for others to understand your thought processes and be able to continue where you left off. Prior to learning about design systems, I was unorganized and my design flow was messy as I was unable to locate relevant files and information fast enough. Collaborating within a team would spell disaster as I would be the only one who knows where everything is located. There is a potential that the mess could snowball when scaling up and this would result in a lot of pain, frustration, and a mountain of backlog work. A well-documented process not only makes collaboration easier and efficient, but also prevent that catastrophe from occurring. 
        <br><br>
        My first step was to start organizing the company’s design folder with a proper naming convention and grouping. In this case, I stuck with two numbers, underscores, and followed by a version, and date for specific files as shown below. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The next step was to document my process and standardization of the system. I made a Google Doc readily accessible to everyone on the team and it is a piece where one can easily understand my thought process and a reference for design information. It includes a usage guide of the system, design philosophies and principles, the necessary tools and required plugins, naming convention of folders / files / layers, best practices and learning resources, and FAQs.

      <h3 class="section " id="philosophies"> Philosophies and theories </h3>
      <p>
        As lead designer, I wanted to develop Arch’s design philosophies in mind of the values that best suits the company and the way design should be implemented and thought about. The result is as such: 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link mb-sm" href="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/philosophies_and_theories.png" alt="image-1" /><img class="example-image mb-sm"  src="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/philosophies_and_theories.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        While learning more about design systems, I’ve came across many systems following <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frost's Atomic Design Theory</a>, which is hugely implemented across many design systems. In short, the theory is about how every design element could be used in various combinations to form more complex combinations and changes made across these ’Symbols’ would be applied across the entire document which makes it really powerful. I was unable to implement the system via Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator rapidly because of the the lack of a similar feature. After a talented designer I networked with showed me how powerful Sketch is, I picked it up and became proficient in it within a month (learning was fast not only because it is easy to pick up but also because of how similar the shortcuts and tools are to Photoshop and Illustrator). With many design system templates and other similar resources, I was able to implement a basic version of the system faster.

      <p>
        I was inspired by Airbnb’s design system where they likened their system to an ‘evolving ecosystem’. I then took that inspiration and applied it to Arch’s design system where we will adaptable and be highly flexible — but not entirely fluid. Instead, Arch’s design system will rely on being <b>modular</b> where we will invent new elements based on the circumstances and archive the old and unwanted. As such, the system will never stale as it is adaptive to create relevant and fresh combinations.

      <h3 class="section " id="styleguide"> Style Guide</h3>
      <p>
        The style guide is a basic component of the design system. Arch engaged Jeff Withers of Cartisien, to design the logo and the initial website of Arch. While he did an amazing job with the foundations and branding of Arch  as well as inspiring design work I did for Arch, there was no standardized style guide for the team to follow. Hence, with Jeff’s prior work, combined with the companie's mission and vision for a more connected and sustainable Earth, I sought to build a comprehensive style guide that was fundamental for the design system.

      <p>
        Choosing the right colors is critical for Arch’s branding identity. I kept the primary and secondary colors that Jeff had used and then experimented with many other colors such as an accent color for functional use that also complements the base colors. Color theory and understanding the psychological effect of colors meant carefully picking the right colors to look visually pleasing and to invoke trust in our brand, security as a whole, and robustness of our systems.

      <h3 class="section " id="typography"> Typography</h3>
      <p>
         Developing the next part of the style guide was more of a challenge for me — Typography. The use of typography should be similar across all platforms so that it gives the user the feeling that they are still using Arch’s products. The typeface that Jeff chose for the marketing website was Montserrat and I personally find that an issue with the Sans Serif font is that while it looks beautiful on Headers and when used uppercase, a lightweight Montserrat has a larger kerning as compared to regular Sans Serif typefaces. The dilemma was then to either replace Montserrat or find another typeface to pair it with. There were a lot of considerations involved, including legal use of font, usability, and matching of the typeface. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided initially on looking for a replacement as I had little experience with type and did not dare risking matching Montserrat with a bad typeface as rebranding multiple times in a short period of time would be disastrous. I looked at places where fonts were not a legal issue (e.g Google Fonts) and one which had multiple weights so that it can be used for hierarchy and emphasis. As I continued searching, changing the entire font was way too major a move and late for the company and I was not confident enough to make the decision entirely. I then took on the alternative choice which was to find a font to pair with and after a few experiments with mock ups on the marketing website and text bodies and chose 'Open Sans’ as the paired font. I made use of the strengths of each typeface - Montserrat being strong and distinct for mostly headers and Open Sans for normal/body text for functional use and being easy to read.

      <p>
        In effort to enhance Arch’s branding, I worked off previous Jeff Wither’s succinct and easy-to-use logo usage guide as inspiration to create a more comprehensive branding guide. As a result, I developed a poster which includes colors, typography, best practices, logo usage, and clear zones as a form of reference for any branding-related questions.

      <p>
        A 8-point grid system brings about a more consistent UI, and designing with one in mind is more developer-friendly reducing the amount of time fiddling and reducing time to code. It also brings about functionality where it can scale for responsive multi-platforms. I adopted a ‘Soft Grid' approach for Arch as it is more flexible where the elements are positioned relative to one another as opposed to have a rigid structure that the 'Hard Grid’ method has. This follows Arch’s modular design style too where elements can be inserted and removed — but in a highly organized fashion.

      <h3 class="section " id="uipattern"> UI pattern library </h3>
      <p>
        Developing a UI pattern library is beneficial to both designers and developers of Arch. Arch currently have very different UIs across all platforms - marketing website, web app, mobile app.  
        <br>
        The first step was to do an UI inventory audit to measure the scale of the problem and to identify what UIs we need to develop, while accounting for all possible states of the each element (clicked, not clicked, active link, inactive etc).
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/uiinventory.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="example-image mb-sm"  src="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/uiinventory.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        Next step was to create a spreadsheet to identify which UI elements has to be designed and developed. Building the UI library is still a work-in-progress.

      <h3 class="section " id="results"> Result and Success </h3>
      <p>
       The end-result is a comprehensive design system that is properly documented and provides easier onboarding for new designers/developers. Building the design foundation for Arch equates to enhancing the overall user experience, efficient prototyping, and lesser questions asked, ultimately enhancing focus and clarity for everyone. 
       <br><br>
        After developing the system, there was not enough time to gauge complete success as pick-up and implementation onto our actual products requires much time. I personally had some success in building more consistent designs such as graphics, templates, and even the website, faster and with less effort — utilizing reusable elements and finding files in the design folder has never been so much easier.
