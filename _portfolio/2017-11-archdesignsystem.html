      <h3>Project info and Problem statement</h3>
      <p> 
       I joined Arch Systems as their first designer (intern) to improve the design of their customer-facing products, the overall customer experience, and the branding of the company. After using the mobile app, web app, and marketing website, I realized that there were inconsistencies in them all — colors, typography, UI, grids etc. There was a need to set up a design language to build the foundation for a more consistent design across all products, and a scaffold to build upon — all via a design system.

      <h3>Goals / purpose  </h3>
      <p>
        A design system with proper documentation and easy-to-iterate assets for the company aims to solve the problem of inconsistency across all products and to provide a library for both designers and developers to rapidly prototype new designs to production without having to redesign / recreate a custom piece each time.
        <br><br>
        As Arch's first designer, I implemented Arch's design strategy from the ground up. Elements of the design systems includes (and is not limited to) color palettes, typography, icon families, grid layouts, design principles, high-fidelity UI pattern library, brand guidelines, code snippets. I worked closely with the frontend engineer, Vanielle Le, to cover the technicalities on the frontend side of the design system.

      <p>The goals for implementing a common language between all teams (design, business, and development) is to ensure the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Improved consistency in design enhances overall user experience for Arch’s product suite to reduce confusion and clutter for users. </li>
        <li> Improved consistency in design will also result in improvement in branding; increased recognizability, tone of voice, etc. </li>
        <li> Business: Reference and templates for marketing purposes — such as type of tone, values, and language (common vocabulary) in marketing messages, and development of marketing collateral templates.</li>
        <li> Design: Reliable and reusable system for any designer to work on — to be efficient in making new assets, and to not waste time redesigning old assets.</li>
        <li> Software and Hardware: Guidance in UI/UX design decisions in development so that they can focus on what they meant to do. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Audience </h3>
      <p>
        The design system is primarily for internal use — Business/Marketing Team, Design Team, Engineering (Frontend, Mobile, and Hardware) Team — All users should be able to understand and pick up the system with ease and be able to focus on the work they need to do without the need to make design decisions or look for design assets.

      <h3>Research / Best Practices  </h3>
      <p>
        Not having implemented a design system before, I picked up the best practices from big companies such as Airbnb, Facebook, Yelp, Salesforce etc.A bulk of my learning came from reading off Medium — a completely overlooked, rich treasure trove of knowledge where you can find high-quality articles and guides for implementing design systems and all other things design-related. These articles are written by experienced and talented designers that made the understanding the concepts, picking up the know-hows of the design system, and detailed steps to quick implementation possible.

      <h3>Documentation and Organization </h3>
      <p>
        I believe the distinction between an average designer and a great designer is how they organize their tools for great work. 'Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe’ — is a how I would describe being organized as a designer. The importance of documentation and organization is such that others can understand your thought process and be able continue where you left off. Prior to learning about design systems, I was unorganized and my design flow was messy as I was unable to locate relevant files and information fast enough. There is also the problem of collaborating within a team where it would spell disaster where I would be the only one who knows where everything is located. There is a potential that the mess can snowball when scaling up and this would result in a lot of pain, frustration, and a mountain of backlog work. A well-documented process not only makes collaboration easier and efficient, but also prevent that catastrophe from occurring.
        <br><br>
        My first step was to start organizing the company’s design folder with a proper naming convention and grouping. In this case, I stuck with two numbers, underscores, and followed by a version, and date for specific files as shown below. 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/documentation_and_organization.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="example-image" src="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/documentation_and_organization.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        The next step was to document my process and standardization of the system. I made a Google Doc readily accessible to everyone on the team and it is a piece where one can easily understand my thought process and a place of reference to find relevant information. It includes a usage guide of the system, design philosophies and principles, the necessary tools and the required plugins, naming convention of folders/files/layers, best practices and learning resources, and FAQs.

      <h3>Philosophies and theories </h3>
      <p>
        As lead designer, I wanted to develop Arch’s design philosophies in mind of the values that best suits the company and the way design could be implemented. The result is as such: 
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/philosophies_and_theories.png" alt="image-1" /><img class="example-image" src="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/philosophies_and_theories.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        While learning more about design systems, I’ve came across many systems following Brad Frost's Atomic Design Theory, which is highly implemented across many systems because of the amazing feature of ’Symbols’ Sketch possesses. In short, the theory is about how every design element could be used in various combinations to form more complex combinations. Changes made across these ’Symbols’ would be applied across the entire document which makes it really powerful. I was unable to implement the system via Photoshop or Illustrator rapidly because of the the lack of a similar feature. I picked up Sketch and became proficient in it within a month (it was fast not only because it is easy to pick up but also because of how similar the shortcuts and concepts are to Photoshop and Illustrator) after a talented designer I networked with, showed me how powerful a tool it is. With many design system templates and other similar resources, I was able to create the system faster.

      <p>
        I was inspired by Airbnb’s design system where they likened their system to an ‘evolving ecosystem’. I then took that inspiration and applied it to Arch’s design system where we will adaptable and be highly flexible — but not entirely fluid. Instead, Arch’s design system will rely on being modular design where we will ‘discover’ and invent new elements based on the circumstances and archive the old and unwanted. As such, the system will never stale as the design is adaptive to create relevant and fresh results.

      <h3>Style Guide</h3>
      <p>
        The style guide is a basic component of the design system. Arch engaged Jeff Withers of Cartisien, to design the logo and the initial website of Arch. While he did an amazing job with the foundations and branding of Arch and inspired the design work I carried out for Arch, there was no standardized style guide for the team to follow. Hence, with Jeff’s prior work, combined with the companie's mission and vision for a more connected and sustainable Earth, I sought to build a comprehensive style guide that was fundamental for the design system.

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <p>
        Choosing the right colors is critical for Arch’s branding identity. I kept the primary and secondary colors that Jeff had used and then experimented with many other colors for functional use that also complements the base colors. Color theory and understanding the psychological effect of colors meant carefully picking the right colors to look visually pleasing and to invoke trust in our brand, security as a whole, and robustness of our systems.

        <ul>
          <li>* Base Color Palette for branding, </li>
          <li>* State Colors for ‘Danger’, ‘Warning’, ‘Info’, and ’Success’ states</li>
          <li>* Shades of Black and Whites</li>
          <li>* Gradients</li>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
          Developing the next part of the style guide was more of a challenge for me — Typography. The use of typography should be similar across all platforms so that it gives the user the feeling that they are still using Arch’s products. The typeface that Jeff chose for the marketing website was Montserrat and I personally find that an issue with the Sans Serif font is that while it looks beautiful on Headers and when used uppercase, a lightweight Montserrat has a larger kerning as compared to regular Sans Serif typefaces. The challenge was then to either find a complete replacement or another font to pair it with. There were a lot of considerations, including legal use of font, usability, and matching of the typeface. I decided initially on looking for a replacement typeface as I had little experience with type and did not dare risking matching Montserrat with a bad typeface as rebranding multiple times in a short period of time would be disastrous. I looked at places where fonts were not a legal issue (e.g Google Fonts) and one which had multiple weights so that it can be used for hierarchy and emphasis. As I continued searching, changing the entire font was way too major a move and late for the company and I was not confident enough to make the decision entirely. I then took on the alternative choice which was to find a font to pair with and after a few experiments with mock ups on the marketing website and text bodies and chose 'Open Sans’ as the paired font. I made use of the strengths of each typeface - Montserrat being strong and distinct for mostly headers and Open Sans for normal/body text for functional use and being easy to read.

      <h3>Brand Guide</h3>
      <p>
        In effort to enhance Arch’s branding, I worked off previous Jeff Wither’s succinct and easy-to-use logo usage guide as inspiration to create a more comprehensive branding guide. As a result, I developed a poster which includes colors, typography, best practices, logo usage, and clear zones as a form of reference for any branding-related questions.

      <h3>Grid System</h3>
      <p>
        A 8-point grid system brings about a more consistent UI, and designing with one in mind is more developer-friendly reducing the amount of time fiddling and reducing time to code. It also brings about functionality where it can scale for responsive multi-platforms. I adopted a ‘Soft Grid' approach for Arch as it is more flexible where the elements are positioned relative to one another as opposed to have a rigid structure that the 'Hard Grid’ method has. This follows Arch’s modular design style too where elements can be inserted and removed — but in a highly organized fashion.

      <h3>UI pattern library </h3>
      <p>
        Developing a UI pattern library is beneficial to both designers and developers of Arch. Arch currently have very different UIs across all platforms - marketing website, web app, mobile app.
        <br>
        The first step was to do an UI inventory audit to measure the scale of the problem and to identify what UIs we need to develop, while accounting for all possible states of the each element (clicked, not clicked, active link, inactive etc).
      </p>
      <a class="example-image-link" href="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/uiinventory.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="example-image" src="/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/uiinventory.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        Next step was to create a spreadsheet to identify which UI elements (including states of each element) has to be designed and developed. The UI library is still a work-in-progress.

      <h3>Result and Success </h3>
      <p>
       The end-result is a timeless design system that is properly documented and provides easier onboarding for new designers/developers. Building the design foundation for Arch equates to enhancing the overall user experience, efficient prototyping, and lesser questions asked, ultimately creating focus and clarity for everyone.  
       <br><br>
        After developing the system, there was not enough time to gauge complete success as pick-up and implementation onto our actual products requires much time. I personally had some success in building more consistent designs such as graphics, templates, and even the website, faster and with less effort — utilizing reusable elements and finding files in the design folder has never been so much easier because of organization.
