      <p> 
       I joined Arch Systems as their first designer (intern) to improve the company's branding and overall customer experience. After using the mobile app, web app, and marketing website, I noticed inconsistencies — colors, typography, UI, grids etc. There was a need to set up foundation for consistent design across all products, a scaffold to build upon via a design system.

      <p>
       A design system with proper documentation and easy-to-iterate assets aims to solve the problem of inconsistency across all products and provide a library for both designers and developers to rapidly prototype new designs to production without redesigning / recreating custom designs each time. 
        <br><br>
        As Arch's first designer, I implemented Arch's design strategy from ground up. The design system includes color palettes, typography, icon families, grid layouts, design principles, high-fidelity UI pattern library, brand guidelines, and code snippets. I worked closely with the frontend engineer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanielle-lee-35662a87/" target="_blank">Vanielle Le</a>, for the frontend technicalities.

      </a>

      <p>
        Goals for implementing a common language amongst the teams: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Improved consistency in design enhances overall user experience for Arch’s products reduces confusion and clutter and better branding.</li>
        <li> Business: Reference and template — language (i.e common vocabulary, increased recognizability, tone of voice) in marketing messages and marketing collateral.</li>
        <li> Design: reusable system with organized asset management for efficient prototyping and prevents producing similar designs.</li>
        <li> Engineering: Reduce UI/UX design decisions. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section " id="audience"> Audience </h3>
      <p>
        The design system is primarily for internal use. All users should be able to onboard with ease and be able to focus without the need to make design decisions or search for design assets / information.
        <br>
        Our target audience would be 
        <ul>
          <li>1) New prospects/customers who would like to know find out more about what Arch does and how we can create value with our products</li>
          <li>2) Existing customers currently engaged in discussions with, to help them understand more about Arch’s solutions and to establish credibility.</li>
          <li>3) The broader community including our team members, family, public partnerships, and the media, to find out more about Arch and how we are working towards our vision for a more connected and sustainable Earth. </li>

      <p>
        Not having implemented a design system before, I picked up the best practices from B2C companies such as Airbnb and Facebook, and B2B companies alike such as Salesforce. A bulk of my learning came from reading off Medium — a completely overlooked, rich treasure trove of knowledge.

      <h3 class="section " id="documentation"> Documentation and Organization </h3>
      <p>
        The distinction between a good designer and a great designer is how they organize their tools for their work. I would compare a designer's organization to this saying. 
        <br><br>
        <i class="highlight">'Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.’</i>
        <br><br>
        Documentation and organization is there for others to understand your thought processes and to be able to continue where you left off. Prior to learning about design systems, I had an unorganized and messy design flow as I was unable to locate relevant files and information. Collaborating within a team would spell disaster as I am the only one who know where everything is located. There is a huge potential that the mess can snowball when scaling up and this would result in a lot of pain, frustration, and a mountain of backlog work. A well-documented process not only makes collaboration easier and efficient, but also prevent that catastrophe from occurring. 
        <br><br>
        My first step was to organize the company’s design folder with a proper naming convention and grouping — I stuck with a convention of two numbers, underscores, and date for specific files and folders as shown below. 
      </p>
      <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/documentation_and_organization.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/documentation_and_organization.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
      <p>
        The next step was to document the process and standardization of the system. I made a Google Doc readily accessible to everyone on the team and where one can easily understand my thought process and a point of reference for design-related information. It includes a usage guide of the design system, design philosophies and principles, the necessary tools and required plugins, naming convention of folders / files / layers, best practices, learning resources, and FAQs.

      <h3 class="section " id="philosophies"> Philosophies and theories </h3>
      <p>
        As lead designer, I wanted to develop Arch’s design philosophies in mind of the values that best suits the company and the way design should be implemented and thought about.
      </p>

      <p>
        While learning more about design systems, I came across many systems applying <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frost's Atomic Design Theory</a> across many design systems. In short, the theory is about how every design element (atoms) could be used in various combinations to form more complex combinations ('molecules', and then 'organisms') and changes made across these ’Symbols’ would be applied across the entire document. I was unable to implement the system via Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator rapidly because of the the lack of a similar feature. After a talented designer showed me how powerful Sketch is, I picked it up and became proficient in it within a month (learning was fast not only because it is easy to pick up but also because of how similar the shortcuts and tools are to Photoshop and Illustrator). With many design system templates and other similar resources, I was able to implement a basic version of the system sooner.

      </a>
      <p>
        I was inspired by Airbnb’s design system where they likened their system to an <i>‘evolving ecosystem’</i>. I took that inspiration and applied it where our design will adaptable and be highly flexible — but not entirely fluid. Instead, Arch’s design system will rely on being <b>modular</b> where we will invent new 'atoms' based on circumstances and archive the unwanted. The system will never stale as it is adaptive, relevant, and fresh.

      <h3 class="section " id="styleguide"> Style Guide</h3>
      <p>
        The style guide is a basic component of the design system. Arch engaged Jeff Withers of Cartisien, to design the logo and the initial website of Arch. While he did an amazing job with the foundations and branding of Arch as well as inspiring the design work I did for Arch, there was no standardized style guide for the team to follow. Hence, with Jeff’s prior work, combined with the company's mission and vision for a more connected and sustainable Earth, I sought to build a comprehensive style guide that was fundamental.

      <p>
        Choosing the right colors is critical for Arch’s branding identity. I kept the primary and secondary colors that Jeff had used and then experimented with various colors such as an accent color for functional use, to complement the base colors. Color theory and understanding the psychological effect of colors meant carefully picking the right colors to look visually pleasing and to invoke trust in our brand, security as a whole, and robustness of our systems.

      <h4 class="section " id="typography"> Typography</h4>
      <p>
         Working on Typography was a challenge for me. The similar type across all platforms gives the user the feeling that they are still using Arch’s products. The typeface that Jeff chose for the marketing website was <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat" target="_blank">Montserrat</a> and I personally find that an issue with the Sans Serif font is that while it looks beautiful on Headers and when used uppercase, a lightweight Montserrat has a larger kerning as compared to regular Sans Serif typefaces. The dilemma was then to either replace Montserrat or find another typeface to pair it with. There were a lot of considerations involved, including legal use of font, usability, and matching of the typeface. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided initially on a replacement as I had little experience with type and did not dare risk matching Montserrat with a bad typeface as rebranding multiple times in a short period of time would be disastrous. I looked at places where fonts were open-sourced (e.g Google Fonts) and one with multiple weights so that it can be used for hierarchy and emphasis. As I continued searching, changing the entire font was way too major a move and late for the company and I was not confident enough to make the decision entirely. I then took on the alternative choice which was to find a font to pair with and after a few experiments with mock ups on the marketing website and text bodies and chose <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans" target="_blank">'Open Sans’</a> as the paired font. I made use of the strengths of each typeface - Montserrat being <b>strong and distinct</b> for mostly headers and Open Sans for normal / body text for <b>functional use and being easy to read</b>.

      <h3 class="section " id="brandguide"> Brand Guide</h3>
      <p>
        In effort to enhance Arch’s branding, I worked off previous Jeff Wither’s succinct and easy-to-use logo usage guide as inspiration to create a more comprehensive branding guide. As a result, I developed a poster which includes colors, typography, best practices, logo usage, and clear zones as a form of reference for any branding-related questions.

      <p>
        An 8-point grid system provides a more consistent UI and designing with one is more developer-friendly, reducing the amount of time fiddling with decorations and time to code. It also brings about functionality where it can scale for responsive multi-platforms. I adopted the <i>‘Soft Grid' </i> as it is more flexible where the elements are positioned relative to one another as opposed to have a rigid structure that the 'Hard Grid’ method has. This follows Arch’s modular design style too where 'atoms' can be inserted and removed in a highly organized fashion.

      <p>
        Developing a UI pattern library is beneficial to both designers and developers of Arch. Arch currently have very different UIs across all platforms - marketing website, web app, mobile app.  
        I did an UI inventory audit to measure the scale of the problem and to identify what UIs we need to develop, while accounting for all possible states of the each element (clicked, not clicked, active link, inactive etc).
      </p>
      <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/uiinventory.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/arch_design_system/uiinventory.png" alt="image-1" /></a>

      <p>
        Next step was to create a spreadsheet to identify which UI elements has to be designed and developed. Building the UI library is still a work-in-progress.

       The end-result is a comprehensive design system that is properly documented and provides easier onboarding, enhances the overall user experience, allows for efficient prototyping, and lesser questions asked — ultimately enhancing focus and clarity for everyone. 
       <br><br>
        After developing the system, there was not enough time to gauge complete success as pick-up and implementation onto our actual products requires time. I personally had great success in building more consistent designs such as graphics, templates, and the marketing website, faster and with less effort — utilizing reusable elements and finding files in the design folder has never been so much easier.

      <p>
         If granted more time, I would have experimented implementating the design system into existing products such as the mobile app and web app as it takes a lot of resources (including frontend engineering efforts) to put it into place. Seeing how this is not vital now at this stage, not implementing minor aspects is a better product strategy. 
         <br><br>
         If implemented, I would conduct a quick survey of the implemented designs to gather the opinions of how users feel about the app.
         <br><br>
         Patching up the rest of the design system — Portions of the design system such as interactions, marketing vocabulary, and marketing tones were missing too. These small components do add up to the user's overall experience with Arch.
