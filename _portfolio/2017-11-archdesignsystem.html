      <p>
        There were design inconsistencies across the Arch's products and internal tools such as multiple typography, colors, and UI components. As first designer at Arch, I took the initiative to organize and standardize design to improve consistency and brand image through a design system -- documentation, style guide, and UI components.

      <p> 
       I joined Arch Systems as their first designer (intern). There were inconsistencies across the mobile app, web app, and marketing website and there was a need to improve consistency across all products.

      <p>
       A design system with proper documentation and easy-to-iterate assets solves the problem of inconsistency and provides a library for both designers and developers to rapidly prototype new designs to production without redesigning/recreating similar designs. 
        <br><br>
        I implemented <span class="tippytooltip" title="color palettes, typography, grid layouts, brand guidelines, etc.">Arch's design system</span> from ground up with frontend engineer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanielle-lee-35662a87/" target="_blank">Vanielle Le</a>, for the frontend technicalities.

        Goals for design system: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Improved consistency enhances overall UX for Arch’s products reducing confusion and provides better branding.</li>
        <!--<li> Business: Reference and template — language (i.e common vocabulary, increased recognizability, tone of voice) in marketing messages and marketing collateral.</li>-->
        <li> Design: Organized system with for efficient prototyping through resuable components.</li>

        I picked up the best practices from companies such as Airbnb, Facebook, and Salesforce.

        <!--The distinction between a good designer and a great designer is how they organize their tools for their work. 
        I would compare a designer's organization to this saying -- 
        <i class="highlight">'Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe'.</i>
        
        <br><br>-->
        Documentation allows others to understand your thought process and continue work you left off. 
        Previously, there was unorganized file management and I was the only one who knew where everything was located. 
        That mess can snowball when scaling up and result in frustration and a mountain of backlog. 
        Good documentation made collaboration easier and efficient, and prevented that catastrophe from occurring. 
        <br><br>
        I organized the company’s design folder with a naming convention — two numbers, underscores, and date for specific files and folders as shown below.

      <p>
        The next step was to document the process and standardization of the system. A Google Doc was made as the single source of truth for 
        <span class="tippytooltip" title="includes usage guide, design philosophies and principles, necessary tools and required plugins, naming conventions, best practices, learning resources, and FAQs">design-related information</span>.

        I applied <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frost's Atomic Design Theory</a> into Arch's design system and inspiration from Airbnb’s <i>‘evolving design ecosystem’</i> and applied it to be adaptable and flexible.

      <p>
        Arch engaged Jeff Withers of Cartisien, to design the logo and the initial website of Arch. While he did an amazing job with the foundations and branding of Arch as well as inspiring the work I did at Arch, there was no standardized style guide for the team to follow. With Jeff’s prior work, combined with the company's mission and vision, I improved the existing style guide.

      <p>
        I kept the primary and secondary colors the same for branding and experimented with an accent color for functional use. Applying Color Theory and Color Psychology, I picked other colors to invoke trust in our brand, security as a whole, and robustness of our systems.

    <div class="box">
      <h4 class="section " id="typography"> Typography</h4>
      <p>
         Working on type was a challenge for me as the choice of type gives the user the feeling that they are using Arch’s products.
         The typeface that Jeff chose for the marketing website was <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat" target="_blank">Montserrat</a> and while it looks gorgeous on Headers and when used uppercase, a lightweight Montserrat has a larger kerning compared to regular Sans Serif typefaces.
         
         The <span class="tippytooltip" title="Considerations involved: legal use of font, usability, and matching of the typeface.">dilemma</span> was then to either replace Montserrat or pair it with another typeface. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not dare risk matching Montserrat with a bad typeface as rebranding multiple times would be disastrous. 
        I searched for typefaces that were <span class="tippytooltip" title="e.g Google Fonts">open-sourced</span> with multiple weights for hierarchy or emphasis. 
        Changing the typeface was too major a move and I was not confident to make the move so I chose <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans" target="_blank">'Open Sans’</a> as the paired typeface. 
        I made use of the strengths of each typeface - Montserrat being <b>strong and distinct</b> for headers, and Open Sans for body text for <b>functional use and being easy to read</b>.

      <p>
        In effort to enhance Arch’s branding, I worked off previous Jeff Wither’s succinct and easy-to-use logo usage guide as inspiration to create a more comprehensive branding guide. As a result, I developed a poster which includes colors, typography, best practices, logo usage, and clear zones as a form of reference for any branding-related questions.

      <h3 class="section " id="grid"> Grid System</h3>
      <p>
        An 8-point grid system provides a more consistent UI and designing with one is more developer-friendly, reducing the amount of time fiddling with decorations and time to code. 
        It also brings about functionality where it can scale for responsive multi-platforms. 
        I adopted the <i>‘Soft Grid' </i> as it is more flexible where the elements are positioned relative to one another as opposed to have a rigid structure that the 'Hard Grid’ method has.

      <p>
        Arch had differing UIs across all its platforms.  
        I did an UI inventory audit to measure the scale of the problem and to identify what UIs we need to develop and accounting for all possible <span class="tippytooltip" title="clicked, not clicked, active link, inactive, etc">states of the each element</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next was to create a spreadsheet to identify which UI elements has to be designed and developed. Building the UI library is still a work-in-progress.

      <p>
       The end-result is a pretty comprehensive design system enhancing the overall consistency, efficient prototyping, and lesser questions asked — ultimately enhancing focus and clarity for everyone. 
       <br><br>
        There was not enough time to gauge success as pick-up and implementation onto actual products required time. 
        I personally had great success in building more consistent designs such as graphics and templates, quicker with lesser effort (utilizing reusable elements and finding files in the design folder has never been so much easier).

    <div class="box">
      <h3 class="section" id="donebetter">What could I have done better?</h3>
      <p>
         If granted more time, I would have experimented implementating the design system into existing products such as the mobile app and web app as it takes a lot of resources (including frontend engineering effort) to put it into place. Seeing how implementation is not vital now at this stage, not implementing design for now is a better product strategy. I would also conduct a quick survey of the implemented designs to gather how users feel about the change in the interface.
         <br><br>
         Patching up the rest of the design system — Portions of the design system such as interactions, marketing vocabulary, and marketing tones were missing too. These small components add up to a user's overall experience with Arch.
