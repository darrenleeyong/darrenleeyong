      <h3 class="section" id="section1"> Introduction</h3>
      <p> 
       I’ve been wanting to do this case study/redesign for a while now since I started using PayLah! at the start of the year. It’s summer vacation and I finally got the capacity to get down to it and it’s a good opportunity to practice my user research skills as well as an excuse to try out Principle for motion design … so I present thee.
       <br><br>
       With Singapore’s recent push towards adopting cashless payments, the development of new technology and adoption of digital payment methods became rampant. Paylah! is a mobile payment solution developed by Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) where transfers are done through a registered mobile number or via QR codes. The app was first introduced as an alternative to internet banking for peer-to-peer transactions. In recent years, payment at brick-and-mortar stores was made possible.
       <br><br>
       <span><i>***I am not affiliated with DBS or any of its partners and did this redesign on my own volition.</i></span>

        <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/paylah.jpeg" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/paylah.jpeg" alt="image-1" /></a>
        <br><br>
        Despite the new look on the app from an update this year, the peer-to-peer transfer process still felt sluggish and the app is cluttered with a surplus of underutilized features that potentially impedes frequent use. I felt that the user experience had so much room for improvement.
        <br><br>
        To help you get a better understanding, I recreated the existing PayLah! experience for non-users and international friends:
        <br><br>
        <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/4bae673?emb=1&iosapp=false&frameless=false" width="453" height="884" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <br><br>
        Got a better idea? Great, now we’re on the same page. You will see that the home screen is littered with tons of features and the payment process has redundant steps like repeated confirmations. PayLah! has great potential to encourage the move towards cashless as the bank has a relatively large
        <a href="https://www.dbs.com/annualreports/2017/deeper.html" target="_blank">user base of 785,000</a>. 
        However, the service only has 15,000 daily transactions, translating to just about 1.9% of total number of accounts (not even accounting for multiple transactions per account). Improving the experience has an impact on adoption and 'stickiness' - 
        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/03/23/the-bottom-line-why-good-ux-design-means-better-business/#347d03612396" target="_blank">when user experience is great, people are more likely to return for regular usage or day-to-day transactions.</a> 
        Design can have a butterfly effect on cashless adoption.
        <br><br>
        Thus, this case study/redesign was inspired to encourage usage and adoption through a better user experience - for users, by a user. My process is guided by qualitative user research, identifying and solving user needs, and utilizing Google's Material Design guidelines.

      <h3 class="section" id="section3">Research: a closer look at the app</h3>

            <h4>User Research/Problem Validation</h4>
          <p>
            <i>"Was I the only one who felt that way?"</i>
            I had to make sure. I did a guerrilla user research study in 2 weeks and interviewed 30+ participants of different demographics including working adults and a former employee of DBS, but majority were millennials in their 20's, and some of whom who had experience using other payment apps in countries such as the US and China. Some interviewees were unqualified as they were not PayLah! users but I still gathered insights of why they are not using the app.
            <br><br>
            Here are my findings:
            <ul>
              <li> 'Pay' and 'Scan QR' are the most-used functions in the app (No one interviewed used 'Request' or 'My QR code'.)</li>
              <li> Most who use 'Scan QR' function started using it only during a campaign that gave a $0.50 discount (economic benefit) in select locations</li>
              <li> 100% don't use/didn't noticed the everyday payments section on front page </li>
              <li> 91% don't see/didn't notice the deals on the front page </li>
              <li> Most don't know about the availability of PayNow function (a method to transfer inter-bank) inside PayLah! Few who knows about it said that it is not obvious </li>
              <li> Non-users are not using PayLah! due to various reasons like confusion (e.g. PayNow versus PayLah!), difficulty in tracking expenses, security concerns, and the idea of handling yet another 'separate' account </li>
            </ul> 
          </p>


          <p>
            Some other noticeable quotes:
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes"> "I scared 'malu' (embarassed) for holding the line if I take too long to pay with PayLah!. I'm not used to it but I know it's just a matter of getting used to." - Manager, Female, 50's</i>
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes"> "Personally, its a bit messy. PayLah! has so many 'squares'. You wouldn't want to go and explore. It's not straightforward. It was first introduced as a concept and notion of fund transfer. So I didn't bother to go explore because of that first impression." - Recent Graduate, Male, Mid-20's</i>
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes"> "I only have PayNow. PayLah quite troublesome actually. It's like holding another account. Need transfer money to there." - Marketer, Female, 30's</i>
            <br><br>
            An interesting finding from an ex-DBS employee was that banks like DBS are very aggressive in pushing for cashless to reduce ATM transactions. The cost of maintaining ATMs is very high due to the need to purchase security, transportation, and insurance for the machines implemented islandwide. Therefore, going cashless is a win-win for both parties - saving costs for banks and providing convenience for users.
          </p>


            <h3>Competitive Analysis of DBS PayLah!</h3>            
          <p>
            To better assess the depth of the problem, I conducted a competitive analysis with similar services. When I was in the Bay Area in 2017, I was introduced to Venmo, a digital wallet app acquired by PayPal, to do transactions with friends. I had a great experience with the app and will be using Venmo as a comparison/benchmark. No wonder it was rated 
            <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-money-transfer-app" target="_blank">No. 1 money transfer app of 2018 by TechRadar </a>
            as well as obtaining a revered status: <b>verb</b> (e.g "I just Venmoed you 5 bucks").
            <br><br>
          </p>


            <h4>Seamless, frictionless peer-to-peer transfers</h4>
          <p>
            Making payments to my friends has never been so simple with Venmo. Venmo has a seamless transfer process where it takes only 8 steps (taps & events) to complete a transaction to a contact compared to DBS requiring at least 13 steps.
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/payments_compare.gif" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/payments_compare.gif" alt="image-1" /></a>
            <br><br>
            In Venmo, payments are <b>people-centric</b> - the form has the recipient's field placed first, followed by the amount, and a compulsory description of the payment. When the 'pay/request' button is pressed, a contact list immediately pops up to your top people (people whom you had often transactions with) and friends list, skipping an extra tap. The process is also hastened by considerations such as a confirmation prompt on the same button and bringing the user directly to the home page displaying their successful transaction.
            <br><br>
          </p>

            <h4>Home Page/Social Feed</h4>
          <p>
            According to Hick's Law, the more choices the users are presented with, the longer it takes to make a decision. The home page of PayLah! has 14 different buttons/choices.  Including the little padding and lack of distinction between each feature, the home screen looks like a deposit of icons. Everything below the pink-gradient fold with the main features is more likely to be ignored as observed in my user research. Additionally, the lack of DBS's brand identity such as the deep red color or a missing logo does not provide a clue that the app was developed by DBS.
            <br><br>
            In Venmo, the first page you land shows a social feed of transactions by your friends. There is only one button on the top right to make/request a payment. It is straightforward and the user performs what they intend to do: monetary transfers.
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/dbs_vs_venmo_homescreen.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/dbs_vs_venmo_homescreen.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes">"I use PayLah! for one purpose - to transfer to friends. Everything else, I don't really care." - Entrepreneur, Male, mid-20's</i>
            <br><br>
          </p>

            <h4>Product Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            Venmo has taken on more of a social approach to peer-to-peer payments with features such as a social feed, forced messages within payments, encouraged use of emojis, and a global feed. It can be integrated with your Facebook account and the ease of seeing your friends (and their friends)allows one to make payments to mutual friends or people not in your contact list easily.
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/venmoglobal.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/venmoglobal.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
            <br><br>
            The approach DBS is taking is similar to WeChat Pay where payments can be made for anything, ranging from utility bills to movie tickets. Similar features are accessible on the PayLah home page but two problems exist: 1) it feels really cluttered and 2) no one I interviewed uses these functions.
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/dbs_vs_wechat_homescreen.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/dbs_vs_wechat_homescreen.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
            <br><br>
            <i class="quotes">"I like WeChat. Feels like PayLah! is copying. Can pay for movie tickets, bills, takeout, and a lot of things. I am impressed because can perform so many functions and doesn't feel confusing. It's very straightforward. But DBS PayLah! feels very messy and a bit hard to navigate. WeChat is clean and slick." -  Graduate, Male, mid-20's</i>

      <h3 class="section" id="section4">The Redesign </h3>

          <h4>Users' Problems to Solve</h4>
          <p>
            Based on my interview findings and research, these are the objectives identified for the redesign:
            <ul>
              <li> Increase visibility of PayNow service within app</li>
              <li> Remove clutter in front page and improve information architecture within app</li>
              <li> Make peer-to-peer payments fast, accounting for reach accessibility of one hand (think payments at store when other hand is occupied) </li>
              <li> Make payment with QR code easier to use </li>
              <li> Make finding unlisted people easier</li>
              <li> Introduce economic benefit for increased usage</li>
              <li> Last but not least, make the entire experience enjoyable</li>
            </ul> 
          </p>
          <br><br>

          <h4>Wireframe and User Flow Chart</h4>
          <p>
            Understanding the users' problems to be solved, I sketched out on pen and paper various versions of mock ups, with each screen aiming to solve the various problems users listed.
            <br><br>
            <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/wirefames.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/wirefames.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
          </p>

          <h4>Getting down to business - My Design Process</h4>
          <p>
            With the wireframe and concepts thought of, it was time to build a high-fidelity prototype. I created a style/branding guide through inference from their latest collateral as DBS's style guide was not made readily public. I was able to whip up a complete UI library within minutes with Google's Material Theme Editor based on the style guide. For unavailable components I require, I build custom parts based on existing components in the library.

      <h3 class="section" id="section5"> Final Result </h3>
      <p>
        After a few sleepless nights and jugs of coffee, I finished designing an interactive prototype of the PayLah I envision. I excitedly showed it to some friends and tweaked it a little more after a round of feedback to before getting to a final/called-it-done version. 
        I conducted simple usability tests with 
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/" target="_blank">  &lt; 10 participants </a>
        and checked if my proposed solution solved their pain points. Their thoughts are presented in the quotes below.
      </p>

      <h4>Rapid peer-to-peer payments</h4>
        <p>
          My priority was to make the core features of the app (peer-to-peer transactions and payments via QR code) lightning fast — as little taps as possible, with the reach accessibility of one hand. I followed Venmo’s method of bringing the contact list and number pad up straightaway and included a ‘Top People’ section showing people whom you frequently and recently interacted with. Additionally, I combined the pay and request pages via a tab at the top right corner so that the request function will be utilized more. You can see a lot of inspiration from Venmo here as I felt they perfected the UX flow for payments.
          <br><br>
          <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/PayLah-Redesign-Pay.gif" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/PayLah-Redesign-Pay.gif" alt="image-1" /></a>
          <br><br>
          I also tidied up the information architecture and hid away the underutilized payment functions in a separate tab.
          <br><br>
          <i class="quotes">"What will be awesome if you streamline everything. When you launch the app, it is it to fund transfer/payment of good. Just make it very easy, just 2 options - just transfer funds or payment at stores." - Student, Male, 20's</i>
          <br><br>
          PayLah! has a username that is only visible to the user (why oh why?). In order to find unlisted friends besides through a phone number or QR code, one can now search for a username/phone number that is linked to an account. Scanning QR can be done via the quickly-accessible floating action button on the contact list page.
          <a class="lightbox" href="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/contactlist.png" data-lightbox="example-1"><img class="portfolio-piece-image mb-md"  src="/dist/images/portfolio/dbspaylah_redesign/contactlist.png" alt="image-1" /></a>
        </p>

      <h4>Brick-and-mortar store payments made easys</h4>
        <p>
          Payments at brick-and-mortar stores can now be done before reaching the counter. You won’t ever have to worry about holding up the line when you scan for QR codes now (you don't even need to scan!). Photos of the storefront also help users know that they are paying to the right vendors.
          <br><br>

           <br><br>
          <i class="quotes">I like it. I get to do the things I want really fast such as Pay and Scan QR. Now I also don't have to hold the line when paying with QR code. Smart!" - Entrepreneur, Male, 20's</i>
        </p>
      
      <h4>Brick-and-mortar store payments made easys</h4>
       <p> 
         When did requesting money from your pals become such a chore? According to my research, usually one requests for money when they cover a bill for their group. Introducing Bill Splitter - add items and the cost to each person to break down your bill including a section that for shared items. Utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, you can drag items and its cost from an attached receipt to the portion. The attached receipt to prevent alternating between your gallery and the app. If you are unable to get the breakdown from the OCR, enter a new line manually for each item on your bill and the app will split it accordingly.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          Oh and humans tend to be forgetful. So let the app remind your friends to make payment on time.

       </p>

      <h4>Brick-and-mortar store payments made easys</h4>
       <p> 
         Payment with PayNow is more obvious with a microcopy ('PAYNOW-enabled') right below their wallet's balance.

       </p>
       
      <h4>Who says payment can't be 'fun'?</h4>
       <p> 
         I included a 'like' button as a form of confirmation feedback for users to acknowledge received payment. Furthermore, I tried to engineer 'fun' into the process - when a user enters an emoji (standard unicode) as the first character of a message, it replaces the default 'like' button in a transaction line, for a personalized experience. Messages are still left optional but this encourages users to input emojis for a more personalized payment to make the experience feel a little more unique. I decided not to make the app social and instead, focus on improving the interaction between the people involved.

         Users would want to know relevant information to be motivated to explore the app. What else might be useful asides from deals about DBS? As an e-wallet app, it made perfect sense to include promotion codes to be used at PayLah!-enabled stores. As seen from the increased usage due to the $0.50 discount campaign, promo codes, as a form of economic benefit, encourages patrons’ usage of the ‘Scan QR’ function. Allowing vendors to submit their own discounts attracts more customers to patronize the store and deal with less physical cash.

      <h4>Red Packets … Just Because</h4>
       <p> 
         Singapore has a 
         <a href="https://www.indexmundi.com/singapore/demographics_profile.html" target="_blank">74.3% Chinese population</a>
         and Lunar New Year is a pretty big deal here - Red Packets are a must, so why not make the experience of giving digital red packets more exciting? The problem with the existing eAngBao feature on PayLah! is that it does not feel unique or any different than a standard transaction. I spiced things up in this redesign to make the red packet experience more meaningful. You can choose from several different featured designs sponsored by brands (as a form of their own marketing) or even customize your own design.

          Red Packets are a symbol of good luck and prosperity and the eAngBao experience should be tad more special! You can also select gamified options such as a random amount (between a range) and a random recipient (between your group of friends) when sending an eAngbao for fun.

          Overall, I was really pleased with the reactions I got from the people I presented my prototype to. It had been a great challenge over the past month balancing between a full-time internship and this side project. This redesign challenged my time management skills and also forced me to get out of my comfort zone to learn more about conducting user research and using Principle for motion design.

          Unfortunately, it was only upon completion that I realized some of the ideas I came up with, such as reminders and splitting the bill, already existed in WeChat (Those geniuses!!!). But  really though … those functions felt necessary even for me to want to use it.
          <br><br>
          Throughout the past month, I learned a lot about my role as a UX designer to do the thinking of how one accomplishes a task - so that users (and hopefully, developers) don't have to. I also gained mad respect to product leaders out there. If you enjoyed reading this case study, destroy the clap button or visit my portfolio to view my other works.

          This project would not have been possible without the users who contributed their precious time to assist me with my research. Sincerely, thank you. 🙏🏻
