      <p> 
       StaffAny is a scheduling app that replaces conventional pen and paper and excel methods and makes communicating and requesting available shifts from your staff much faster. 
       The idea of the sprint is to find a better product-market fit, to understand our user needs better, and to test for assumptions before investing engineering efforts for development of the app.

       <br><br>
       "The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Working together in a sprint, you can shortcut the endless-debate cycle and compress months of time into a single week. Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, you’ll get clear data from a realistic prototype. The sprint gives you a superpower: You can fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitments." - <b>Google Ventures</b>

      <p>Goals for this sprint would be: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Test and validate hypotheses/assumptions of scheduling/shift managers' needs and pain points. </li>
        <li> Develop an interactive prototype that has a user flow similar (or better) than existing solutions / methods.</li>
        <!--<li>  </li>-->
      </ol>

      <p>
        I would be working closely with a talented team of 6 from diverse backgrounds where we can leverage on our strengths, skillsets where we can complement each other. 
        Our team is well-packed: we have our CEO and cofounder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janson-seah/">Janson Seah</a>,

          "Monday’s structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. In the morning, you’ll start at the end and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you’ll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll ask the experts at your company to share what they know. Finally, you’ll pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week."

          "After a full day of understanding the problem and choosing a target for your sprint, on Tuesday, you get to focus on solutions. The day starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to remix and improve. Then, in the afternoon, each person will sketch, following a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry. You’ll also begin planning Friday’s customer test by recruiting customers that fit your target profile."

          "By Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. That’s great, but it’s also a problem. You can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. In the morning, you’ll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype."

          "On Wednesday, you and your team created a storyboard. On Thursday, you’ll adopt a “fake it” philosophy to turn that storyboard into a prototype. A realistic façade is all you need to test with customers, and here’s the best part: by focusing on the customer-facing surface of your product or service, you can finish your prototype in just one day. On Thursday, you’ll also make sure everything is ready for Friday’s test by confirming the schedule, reviewing the prototype, and writing an interview script."

          "Your sprint began with a big challenge, an excellent team—and not much else. By Friday, you’ve created promising solutions, chosen the best, and built a realistic prototype. That alone would make for an impressively productive week. But you’ll take it one step further as you interview customers and learn by watching them react to your prototype. This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of the day, you’ll know how far you have to go, and you’ll know just what to do next."
