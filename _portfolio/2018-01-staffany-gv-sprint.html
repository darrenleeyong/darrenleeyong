      <p> 
       <b>StaffAny</b> is a scheduling app that aims to replace conventional scheduling methods, such as using pen and paper, or excel. StaffAny makes communicating with teams and requesting for shifts from your staff more efficient and simpler.
       The overarching theme for conducting a sprint is to find a <span class="highlight"> better product-market fit — to understand our user needs better and to (in)validate assumptions of our users and existing solutions,</span> all to filter down and focus our energies on what is essential for the first iteration of our product before investing engineering efforts for development of the app.

       <h4><i>"The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Working together in a sprint, you can shortcut the endless-debate cycle and compress months of time into a single week. Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, you’ll get clear data from a realistic prototype. The sprint gives you a superpower: You can fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitments." - <b>Google Ventures</i></b>

      <p>Big Goals for this sprint would be: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Test and (in)validate hypotheses and assumptions of scheduling/shift managers' needs and pain points. </li>
        <li> Develop an interactive prototype that has a user flow similar (or better) than existing methods.</li>
        <li> Take these new learnings to create an MVP (or if fail to do so, conduct new sprint for better understanding) </li>
      </ol>
      <br>

          <h4>"Monday’s structured discussions create a <i>path</i> for the sprint week. In the morning, you’ll start at the end and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you’ll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll ask the experts at your company to share what they know. Finally, you’ll pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week." - GV</h4>
          <br><br>
      <p>    
          We all gathered together at 10am and introduced ourselves before getting briefed about the five-day sprint process by the sprintmaster, Keith. 
          Then, we set our sprint questions, asked many many questions. This is to have a better idea of what we want to achieve at the end of the sprint.  
          <br><br>

          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/1_monday1.jpg">
          <br><br>
          We made a list of sprint questions we aiming to solve, potential customer segments to target, and then prioritized/filtered the areas to <b>focus our resources for on this sprint.</b>
          <br><br>
          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/1_monday2.jpg">
          <br><br>
          Next, a map with customers and keyplayers were drawn out to understand the <b>processes and pain points of the user</b>. Drawing one out gave us a better understanding of the users' needs and for us to visualize which pain points requires more attention. 
          <br><br>
          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/1_monday3.jpg">
          <br><br>
          Having one of our team members having experience as a shift manager, and myself with experience an part-time staff (me), we were able to understand the process a little better from our own experiences and updated our map, questions, and long-term goals accordingly.
          We did the <b>'How Might We' exercise</b> where we challenged ourselves to innovate opportunitities from pain points and casted votes on it using stickers. There were many debates but the ones with the most stickers were weighed in more, and moved to the map. 

          We found an area of the map that we wanted to focus on Monday which sets the direction of the sprint. We then brought back homework of analysing 3 competitors and their solutions.

          <h4>"After a full day of understanding the problem and choosing a target for your sprint, on Tuesday, you get to focus on solutions. The day starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to remix and improve. Then, in the afternoon, each person will sketch, following a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry. You’ll also begin planning Friday’s customer test by recruiting customers that fit your target profile." — GV</h4>
          <br><br>
          <p>
          Day 2. We present our findings of existing solutions/competitors and voted for ideas with stickers again on the features that we might want to adopt to form a <b>heatmap.</b> 
          <br><br>
          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/2_tuesday1.jpg">
          <br><br>

          We then take the key ideas and everyone crafts them into our own solutions through sketches (Four-Step Sketch). We also start looking out for interviewees for the Friday.

          <h4>"By Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. That’s great, but it’s also a problem. You can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. In the morning, you’ll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype." — GV</h4>
          <br><br>
        <p>
          From our interactions on Tuesday, we also made new learnings, better understanding of the user processes and needs, and cleaned up the user map. 
          From Tuesday, we have a stack of solutions and will spend the day <span class="highlight">filtering and critiquing these solutions</span> via heatmapping (stickers) and dicussions on which winning scenes should go into the storyboard: a step-by-step plan for the prototype.

          <br><br>
          
          Using the heatmap method where each of us are given 3 stickers to place on our favorite ideas, we managed to decide on ideas we want to develop and then began storyboarding (not shown here).

          <h4>"On Wednesday, you and your team created a storyboard. On Thursday, you’ll adopt a “fake it” philosophy to turn that storyboard into a prototype. A realistic façade is all you need to test with customers, and here’s the best part: by focusing on the customer-facing surface of your product or service, you can finish your prototype in just one day. On Thursday, you’ll also make sure everything is ready for Friday’s test by confirming the schedule, reviewing the prototype, and writing an interview script." - GV</h4>
          <br><br>
    <p>
          It's a day before the Test day (Friday) and we have to make sure that we have everything we need for our user interviews — a guideline of interview topics and questions regarding our sprint, a confirmed schedule of interviewees, and a realistic-looking prototype for testing. We split up the workload and delegated tasks based on our skillsets. Having a detailed storyboard with <b>ONE final story</b> in mind, we then carried out the next phase — prototyping. We made a low-fidelity wireframe so that we do not invest too much effort on a high-fidelity prototype and prevent 're-work' to manage expectations. We used Sketch for both wireframing and prototyping where I provided a wireframing kit and an UI kit for the sprint for faster iteration.

          After the wireframe was done, I completed the rest of the prototype and stitching it up on InVision.

          <h4>"Your sprint began with a big challenge, an excellent team—and not much else. By Friday, you’ve created promising solutions, chosen the best, and built a realistic prototype. That alone would make for an impressively productive week. But you’ll take it one step further as you interview customers and learn by watching them react to your prototype. This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of the day, you’ll know how far you have to go, and you’ll know just what to do next." - GV </h4>
          <br><br>
        <p>
          The hotlinking of the prototype (InVision) was completed on Friday morning and we did a few rounds of testing and briefing for the interviews. 
          We had a semi-structured way of gaining information such as asking about their scheduling and communication processes, current solutions and practices, and the pain points before asking them to play around with our interactive prototype. 
          <br><br>

          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/5_friday1.jpg">
          <br><br>

          During the interviews that we have scheduled, we broke ourselves up with various roles such as the interviewers, recorderers (video references to record interactions), and scribers to take down important insights/ideas that the interviewee provide. The interviewee was made sure to not be so guided to test the usability of the prototype and to see if the 'features/solutions' we brainstormed resolved their pain point and whether they were willing to pay or not. All the information is collated and everyone is involved in the interview process to gain a better understanding of our users (crucial to make sure everyone is on the same page). 
          <br><br>

          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/5_friday2.jpg">
          <br><br>

          After our interviews, we had a debrief and summarized our learnings from our user interviews. We learned a lot more about our target audience, their needs, and where their main pain points about the scheduling process. We eliminated and invalidated key assumptions and with those key learnings, we are thus form the scope for the product development process (which was to do more sprints to find validate other assumptions) - all to create a better product suiting our users' needs.
