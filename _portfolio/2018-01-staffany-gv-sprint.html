      <p> 
       StaffAny is a scheduling app that replaces conventional pen and paper and excel methods and makes communicating and requesting available shifts from your staff much faster. 
       The idea of the sprint is to find a better product-market fit, to understand our user needs better, and to test for assumptions before investing engineering efforts for development of the app.

       <br><br>
       "The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Working together in a sprint, you can shortcut the endless-debate cycle and compress months of time into a single week. Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, you’ll get clear data from a realistic prototype. The sprint gives you a superpower: You can fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitments." - <b>Google Ventures</b>

      </p>

      <p>Goals for this sprint would be: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Test and validate hypotheses/assumptions of scheduling/shift managers' needs and pain points. </li>
        <li> Develop an interactive prototype that has a user flow similar (or better) than existing solutions / methods.</li>
        <!--<li>  </li>-->
      </ol>

      <p>
        I would be working closely with a talented team of 6 from diverse backgrounds where we can leverage on our strengths, skillsets where we can complement each other. 
        Our team is well-packed: we have our CEO and cofounder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janson-seah/">Janson Seah</a>, 
        cofounder and lead product, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kai-yi-lee/" target="_blank">Lee Kai Yi</a>,

      <p>
          "Monday’s structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. In the morning, you’ll start at the end and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you’ll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll ask the experts at your company to share what they know. Finally, you’ll pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week." - GV
          <br><br>
          
          We all gathered together at 10am for our first meeting. We introduced ourselves and was briefed about the five-day sprint process by the sprint master. 
          Then we set our sprint questions, and asked many many questions, all to have a better idea of what we want to achieve at the end of the sprint.  
          <br><br>

          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/1_monday1.jpg">
          <br><br>
          We made a list of potential customers to target and then chose one to focus our energy on this sprint.
          <br><br>
          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/1_monday2.jpg">
          <br><br>
          A user journey map was then drawn out to understand the processes and pain points of the user. Drawing one out gives us a better understanding of the users' needs and which pain points requires the most attention for solving. 
          <br><br>
          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/1_monday3.jpg">
          <br><br>
          The sprintmaster then asked that we do the 'How Might We' exercise where we challenge ourselves to come up with innovative opportunitities from these pain points and then we cast a vote on it. 

          We found an area that we wanted to focus on and then had some homework to do where we would analyse 3 competitors and similar solutions each.

      <p>
          "After a full day of understanding the problem and choosing a target for your sprint, on Tuesday, you get to focus on solutions. The day starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to remix and improve. Then, in the afternoon, each person will sketch, following a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry. You’ll also begin planning Friday’s customer test by recruiting customers that fit your target profile." — GV
          <br><br>

          Day 2. We present our findings of current solutions/competitors and voted for ideas with stickers again on the features that we might want to adopt. 
          <br><br>
          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/2_tuesday1.jpg">
          <br><br>

          The next part is where we take key ideas and craft them into our own solutions — going all creative with how we might solve the problem. We also start looking out for interviewees.

      <p>
          "By Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. That’s great, but it’s also a problem. You can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. In the morning, you’ll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype." — GV
          <br><br>

          We have tons of solutions from everyone on the team but we need to filter down to what we want to build. But before we did so, we have made new learnings and could better define the user journey map. 
        <br><br>
          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/3_wednesday1.jpg">
          <br><br>

          Using the heatmap method where each of us are given 3 stickers to place on our favorite ideas, we managed to decide on ideas we want to develop and then began storyboarding (not shown here).

      <h3 class="section" id="thursday"> <a href="" target="_blank"> Day 4 — Thursday</a>   </h3>
      <p>
          "On Wednesday, you and your team created a storyboard. On Thursday, you’ll adopt a “fake it” philosophy to turn that storyboard into a prototype. A realistic façade is all you need to test with customers, and here’s the best part: by focusing on the customer-facing surface of your product or service, you can finish your prototype in just one day. On Thursday, you’ll also make sure everything is ready for Friday’s test by confirming the schedule, reviewing the prototype, and writing an interview script." - GV
          <br><br>

          Having a detailed storyboard with ONE user story in mind, we then carried out the next phase where my skills shined the most — design. Based on the storyboard, we then had to make a wireframe. The low fidelity wireframe was necessary so that we do not invest too much design effort on the high fidelity prototype and then when the idea/logic is not expected, the amount of 'rework' is going to be tough. We used Sketch for both wireframing and prototyping where I provided a wireframing kit and an UI kit for the sprint.

          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/4_thursday2.jpg">
          <br><br>

          After the wireframe was done, I completed the rest of the design work for the prototype. 
          <br><br>

      <p>
          "Your sprint began with a big challenge, an excellent team—and not much else. By Friday, you’ve created promising solutions, chosen the best, and built a realistic prototype. That alone would make for an impressively productive week. But you’ll take it one step further as you interview customers and learn by watching them react to your prototype. This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of the day, you’ll know how far you have to go, and you’ll know just what to do next."
          <br><br>

          The hotlinking of the screen was completed on Friday morning and we did a few rounds of testing and briefing for the interviews. 
          We had a semi-structured way of gaining information such as asking about processes, current solutions, and the pain points before asking them to play around with our interactive prototype. 
          <br><br>

          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/5_friday1.jpg">
          <br><br>

          During the interviews that we have scheduled, we broke ourselves up with various roles such as the interviewer and scribers to take down important insights/ideas that the interviewee provide.
          <br><br>

          <img src="/dist/images/portfolio/staffany_sprint/5_friday2.jpg">
          <br><br>

          After our interviews, we had a debrief and learned a lot more about our target audience. We eliminated and invalidated key assumptions that we all thought was right. With those key learnings, we are thus able to create a better product that is more suited to the customers' needs.
