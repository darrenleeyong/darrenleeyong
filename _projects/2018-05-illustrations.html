      <p> 
       Pictures paint a thousand words. I had always been intrigued by illustration and visual design but did not really dare to dwell in an area I was weak at. It was only recently during my 2018 summer internship at Sea Labs where I got inspired 
       by <a href="https://www.behance.net/linfengshe" target="_blank"> my mentor, Qian Ji Dong</a>, who taught me closely how to use colors and shapes to design beautiful illustrations. I began practicing to improve my visual design sense and skills and this page will showcase my future work. I will eventually have my work up on Behance and Dribbble.

      <p>
        My very first piece. Started out as practice but got caught in the process and continued desiging the piece. The idea was inspired by my upcoming road trip to visit Yellowstone. Designed in Sketch.

        These illustrations were featured on my Medium post on work done at StaffAny as a workaround for an NDA. Started out with sketches on paper and then did the vector illustrations on Sketch.

        I took a game design class where we took on projects to design a board game and a computer game where I was in charge of producing content/assets and promotional assets.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h4>Tetroshuffle</h4>
      <p>Form combinations based on their respective combination cards and be the fastest to collect three combination cards! At the beginning of the game, players both get a card with two possible combinations on them.
      Players take turns to draw a piece from the bag.
      They must place the piece on the board on their turn, attempting to form one of the combinations on their cards. This combination must be able to be taken off the board in its entirety.
      <br><br>
      When the combination is formed on the board, they place the completed combination back into the bag, and they keep their card, drawing a new card.
      The player that gets three cards first wins.
      </p>

      <br><br> 
      <h4>Fishsics</h4>
      <p>
        Fishsics is a single player continuous side-scrolling game where you play a fabulous flying fish whose goal is to fly above water with style without being eaten by predators above, and below the sea. The fish can dive underwater, spring up above water and glide in the air. The game ends when the fish gets eaten by a bird, shark or hit by jellyfish, and increases in difficulty as predators get faster and appear more frequently.
        <br><br>
        I will host the game on a link once it is available to the public.
