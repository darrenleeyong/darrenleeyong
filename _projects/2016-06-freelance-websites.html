      <p>
        This is my first web design project after picking up 
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/learn/v4/overview" target="_blank" >basic frontend knowledge (HTML and CSS)</a>
         over the summer of 2015. 
        I took on this project with the limited knowledge that I had and experimented with design aspects but along the requirements of the client and managed to craft a website based on what I learned over summer.
