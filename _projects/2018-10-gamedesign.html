      <p> 
       I took a game design class in AY2018/19 where we formed groups to design a board game and a computer game. I was mostly left in charge of producing content/assets, promotional material, and gave input on the dynamics of the game.

      <p>
        Fishsics is a single player continuous side-scrolling game where you play a fabulous flying fish whose goal is to fly above water with style without being eaten by predators above, and below the sea. The fish can dive underwater, spring up above water and glide in the air. The game ends when the fish gets eaten by a bird, shark or hit by jellyfish, and increases in difficulty as predators get faster and appear more frequently.
        <br><br>
        Here's a <a href="/fishsics">link</a> to an early version of the game (PC only) in its experimental stage. Any feedback is welcome to <a href="mailto:darrenlee@u.nus.edu" target="_blank">my group and I</a>, or whoever sent you the link.

      <!--<h4>Tetroshuffle</h4>-->
      <p>Form combinations based on their respective combination cards and be the fastest to collect three combination cards! At the beginning of the game, players both get a card with two possible combinations on them.
      Players take turns to draw a piece from the bag.
      They must place the piece on the board on their turn, attempting to form one of the combinations on their cards. This combination must be able to be taken off the board in its entirety.
      <br><br>
      When the combination is formed on the board, they place the completed combination back into the bag, and they keep their card, drawing a new card.
      The player that gets three cards first wins.
